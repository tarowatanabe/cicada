Jodo Shinshu ( Shin-Buddhism / True Pure Land Sect ) is one of the sects of Japanese Buddhism , and a religious community that Shinran , an apprentice of Honen , succeeded and which developed Honen 's doctrine ( Jodo Shu / Pure Land Buddhism ) in the early Kamakura period . 
Due to the historical background of the origin of the sect name , most sects belonging to this religion call themselves Shinshu as a sect name . 
It used to also be called Ikko Shu and Monto Shu . 
Doctrine 
By saying a prayer ( Shomyo nenbutsu ) to the Buddha ( Namu Amida Butsu , Namo Amida Butsu by Hongan-ji School ) , practitioners can believe in the mercy of Amida Nyorai ( hereinafter called " Nyorai " ) , and trust in Tariki ( Buddha 's power ) , which makes everyone , including the bad , go to Jodo ( Pure Land ) after death and become Buddha . 
Through this , the doctrine of Shinshu is called " Shinjin Shoin , Shomyo Ho-on " ( Faith makes it happen , and praying is for gratitude ) . 
Rennyo , the 8th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , stated in " Ofumi " as follows . 
" First of all , the policy of Kaisan Sho 'nin ( Shinran ) gives faith first priority . 
What use is faith us , shameless unenlightened men , who do wrong without good deed , to easily go to Jodo of Mida ( Amida ) . 
Without acquiring this faith , no one could go to paradise and avoid falling to Muken Jigoku ( Avici Hell ) . 
Regarding " Shomyo Ho-on , " he mentioned " On that basis , we should be aware that Shomyo nenbutsu is Buddhist invocation to appreciate the kindness ( Go-on Hojin ) that Nyorai decided that we could go to Heaven . " ( ib. book5 , chapter10 ) , which means that Shomyo nenbutsu in Jodo Shinshu are words of gratitude for Nyorai 's salvation . 
This is based on Forty-eight Vows of " Infinite Life Sutra ( Bussetsu Muryojukyo ) " , especially the Eighteenth Vow ( Senjaku Hongan ) called " O 'Hongan ) . 
The principal image ( Honzon ) is only Amida Nyorai . 
However , Takada School and a part of the sect have Amida Nyorai , Kanzeon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu as their principal images , in Zenko-ji Amida Sanson style . 
Generally , the idea that " the vow of Amida Nyorai is offered to us even at this moment and we are saved " ( Gensho shojoju ) was misunderstood by a number of people , and repeatedly corrected . 
Rennyo mentioned in " Ofumi ( Gobunsho ) " ; 
" Not forgetting the kindness of Mida , who decided that we could go to Heaven long time ago , when achieving enlightenment is what faith is about . 
This is a big misconception . 
Even though we know the story of Mida Nyorai 's achieving enlightenment , it does not mean anything if we do not know the story of faith in Tariki that we can go to Heaven . " 
He explained here that knowing how Nyorai became Buddha is merely knowledge , and it is important to know the origin of faith in Tariki given by Nyorai ( faith in truth ) . 
He confirmed Shinjin Shoin here and defined correctly , and never mentioned " Reciting nenbutsu simply takes everyone to paradise " . 
In Jodo Shinshu , faith given by Nyorai helps people . 
Nenbutsu is definitely recited for gratitude , not the condition of going to Heaven . 
Shinran also mentioned " What gets you to Nehan ( Nirvana ) is only faith " in " Kyogo shinsho " , and " Regard that true faith gets you to Anoku bodai ( ultimate enlightenment ) " in " Songo shinzo meimon " . 
What makes Shinshu greatly different from other Buddhist sects is that monks have no commandments and are allowed to eat meat and to get married ( Nikujiki-Saitai ) . ( Shinshu was the only sect that allowed monks to get married until the Meiji period . ) 
Originally , Shinran learned that helping those who can not help but stray from the concept of a general monk ( who enters the priesthood and practices asceticism , renouncing the world ) and the norm of Buddhists ( laity ) living in the world is Hongan Nenbutsu ( praying for the vows ) from his master Honen , and became the first monk to openly get married and have a child . 
Therefore , Shinshu has two lineages , which are Homyaku ( master -apprentice relationship ) and Kechimyaku ( blood relationship ) . 
And the given name is called Homyo instead of Kaimyo . 
With its doctrine that everyone can go to Heaven ( Ojo jobutsu ) only by trusting Nyorai 's power ( in other words , if acquiring true faith ) , Shinshu , compared to other sects , is free from many religious exercises and customs , and makes much of nenbutsu and Mombo ( learning the teachings of Buddha ) for Ho-on Shatoku ( gratitude for kindness and virtue ) . 
It is the only Buddhist sect that does n't perform Kaji kito ( incantation ) , which is another major feature of Shinshu . 
Since it values rationality and has simple manners and teachings , it was widely accepted among the public in early modern ages , but on the other hand , it provoked antipathy from other sects and often got ridicule such as " Monto ( Shinshu followers ) know nothing " . 
Shinshu also encouraged each household to enshrine its Honzon ( Myogo Honzon of " Namu Amida Butsu " , or a picture or statue of Amida Nyorai ) . 
The " rules " on Shogon ( decoration ) of the Buddhist altar for enshrinement are more strict than other sects . 
Shogon imitates Honzan ( the head temple ) , which makes each sect of Shinshu have different style and different ritual articles . 
A Honzon enshrined and decorated in the Buddhist altar is called " Onaibutsu " in Shinshu . 
Shinshu does n't use this as a family altar or prayer altar . 
The Honzan of each Shinshu sect basically has a Goei-do hall to enshrine a portrait of Shinran , the founder , as well as a main hall ( Amida-do hall ) to enshrine Amida Nyorai , the Honzon . 
Additionally , the architecture of Shinshu temples has unique features rarely seen in other sects , such as wider Gejin ( nave ) compared to Naijin ( chancel ) . 
Each sect holds a memorial service called " Ho-onko " on the anniversary of the death of the founder Shinran Sho 'nin . 
This memorial service is held to give thanks for the blessing of Gudo and Gukyo ( seeking and promoting the teachings ) , and the blessing of Amida Nyorai acquired through them , and to recognize the teachings . 
This is the biggest event in a year . 
However , the day of the memorial service depends on each sect of Shinshu . 
( See the schedule of Goshoki Ho-onko by sect for details . ) 
The legitimate scriptures are Jodo sanbukyo ( Three Pure Land sutras ) . 
The works of Shichi Koso ( seven high priests ) are also highly respected , although they are not scriptures . 
" Muryojukyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge " by Tenjin was especially esteemed along with Jodo sanbukyo by his master Honen , who called these " Sankyo Ichiron " ( three sutras and one book ) . 
Shinran especially esteemed " Bussetsu Muryojukyo " and called it " Daimuryojukyo " or " Daikyo " .

Though " Ofumi ( Gobunsho ) " by Rennyo is respected along with the legitimate scriptures by Hongan-ji School and Otani School , it is not used by some sects such as Takada School . 
( Since Rennyo had Kechimyaku from Hongan-ji Temple , the sects who value Homyaku from the founder Shinran do not use his work . 
Hongan-ji School of Rennyo and Takada School have a history of fight and conflict . ) 
The founder Shinran took the lineage of Tariki Nenbutsu to Shakamuni and Shichi Koso into consideration , and devoted himself to succeed " the teachings of Jodo Shu as the true religion " and to enhance it , through his life after he regarded Honen ( the founder of Jodo Shu ) as his master . 
Different interpretations of Hongan and Nenbutsu by the apprentices after Honen 's death made Seizan and other Schools of Jodo Shu criticize Shinran . 
Shinran mentioned that " My master Genku ( Honen ) appeared by Chie ko ( the power of Amida Nyorai ) , started Jodo Shinshu and stated Senjaku Hongan " in " Koso Wasan " written during his life , which shows he thought that Jodo Shinshu consisted of the teachings of Jodo Shinshu started by Honen and carried on by himself . 
Whereas , Rennyo 's thoughts were ; 
" Soshi Sho 'nin ( Shinran ) already established Jodo Shinshu - it has superior significance to Jodo Shu and he added the letter Shin ( True ) and named it Jodo Shinshu . " 
This shows that the view of the name of Jodo Shinshu , has changed with the times . 
Since Shinran ( Jogen no Honan ) , engaged in his missionary work mainly in the Kanto region ; after deportation to Echigo , Monto followers who got the teachings of Shinran built up in Kanto region . 
After Shinran died , it was formed as an independent religion from Jodo Shu . 
Though the successors of the teachings of Shinran had the feeling that their own doctrine was the true teaching for going to Jodo , they named themselves just Shinshu at that time because naming themselves Jodo Shinshu could be interpreted as denial of Jodo Shu . 
In fact , Jodo Shu and Ji Shu also called themselves " Jodo Shinshu " or " Shinshu " once , and Kyu Ikko-ha of Ji Shu ( the founder : Shunsho IKKO ) was called " Ikko Shu " once . 
In the early modern era , the Edo Shogunate prohibited them from naming themselves " Jodo Shinshu " under pressure from Jodo Shu , which made them call themselves " Ikko Shu " officially ( on the other hand , the lineage of Shunsho Ikko which originally called themselves " Ikko Shu " was forced to be integrated into Ji Shu which was originally unrelated ) . 
The conflict between Jodo Shinshu and Jodo Shu over the question whether or not the Shinran lineages could name themselves " Jodo Shinshu " was called Shumei Ronso , which lasted for 15 years from 1774 . 
In 1872 , Dajokan Seiin issued an edict to each prefecture , saying " The name of Ikko Shu can be changed to Shinshu , " and finally here in the modern ages , describing it as " ( Jodo ) Shinshu " was allowed . 
History 
The Days of Shinran 
After Shinran died , his great-grandson Kakunyo ( 1270-1351 ) alleged the legitimacy of succession of Shinran 's grave on the grounds of Sandai-denji ( Tradition of three generation ) and so on , and built Hongan-ji Temple ( also known as Otani Hongan-ji Temple ) and called himself the third head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple . 
Against his movement , Ryogen ( 1295-1336 ) , the seventh head-priest of Bukko-ji Temple , who succeeded the lineage of Shinran 's disciples in Kanto region , and other Homyaku gradually took an opposing stance against Hongan-ji Temple , having Bukko-ji Temple and Senju-ji Temple as their bases . 
Jodo Shinshu in those days had active missionary work in Bukko-ji Temple and Senju-ji Temple and acquired a number of followers , but Hongan-ji Temple just existed as a branch temple of Tendai Shu before the 8th head-priest Rennyo . 
From emergence of Rennyo to Ishiyama Hongan-ji War 
Rennyo ( 1415-1499 ) , the 8th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , who emerged in the late Muromachi period , established an organization called Kou against the backdrop of the growth of the public at the time , provided the opportunity for people to learn the teachings equally and to come together , and wrote " Ofumi ( Gobunsho ) " explaining the teachings of Shinran in plain words and disseminated it widely to the public . 
By his achievement , Hongan-ji Temple rapidly developed and expanded , and came to be called Ikko Shu . ( On the contrary , other sects of Shinshu went into decline . ) 
The strength of the group of followers in this Kou was directed at politicians ( such as Daimyo ) , despite Rennyo 's restraint . 
Kokujin ( village heads ) and Dogo ( powerful families ) converted to Shinshu and joined the village people who were discontent with the system with complicated and multiple lordship in the end of the middle ages , and uprising called " Ikko-Ikki " were staged throughout the nation by united Ikko Shu followers from the whole county or province . 
This led to frequent rebellions against Daimyo throughout the nation , such as the one in Kaga described below , and numbers of Daimyo , including Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Kenshin UESUGI , issued the anti-Ikkoshu edicts ( Kinkyorei ) . 
The Shimazu clan in Satsuma Province particularly continued the Kinkyorei until the Meiji period , which made Shinshu followers organize Kou and observe their faith secretly in a cave in the mountains . ( Kakure Nenbutsu / Secret faith ) 
Later , when the Onin War ( 1467-1477 ) broke out and an internal conflict occurred between East and West squads in Kaga Province , north of Yoshizaki Gobo , as the base of Hongan-ji Temple at that time in Echizen Province , the Monto of Senshu-ji School took the side of Kochiyo TOGASHI who took part in the West squad , while the Monto of Honganji School , through the assistance of Takakage ASAKURA , the Daimyo of Echizen ( the 7th chief ) , took the side of Masachika TOGASHI , Kochiyo 's brother and a former Shugo deported from Kaga , who belonged to East squad , and deported Kochiyo in 1474 . ( In other words , Ikko-Ikki in Kaga was started as a power struggle inside Shinshu ) 
However , Hongan-ji 's Monto and Masachika TOGASHI opposed each other after that , and when Masachika sent a force to subdue Ikko Shu in 1488 , they forced Masachika to commit suicide by his sword , and achieved autonomous control ( However , Masataka TOGASHI of the Togashi clan showed sympathy for Ikko-Ikki , and he remained Shugo Daimyo symbolically ) . 
After that , the Monto aimed to recapture the meeting house ( Dojo ) in Yoshizaki of which the Asakura clan had deprived , and Monto mustered from all over Hokuriku area fought against the Asakura clan more than once . 
Meanwhile , in Kinai , the headquarters were Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple , which Rennyo , moving from Yoshizaki , had built in Kyoto in 1482 , and Harumoto HOSOKAWA , being afraid of its influence , set fire to Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple in August in 1532 in conspiracy with Nichiren Shu followers ( Shinshu calls this " Tenbun no Sakuran , " and Nichiren Shu " tenbun Hokke no Ran " ) . 
Hongan-ji Temple lost their headquarters by this incident , and moved it to a temple in Ishiyama in Osaka , which Rennyo had built in his final years ( 1496 ) , and lived in ( Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple ) . 
Since then , Osaka developed around the monastery of Hongan-ji Temple , comparable to a castle , and a temple town formed around it , and it strength frightened power people of the time . 
In 1568 , when Nobunaga ODA conquered Kinai and came into conflict with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA who became the Seii Taishogun , Kennyo ( 1543-1592 ) , the 11th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , took the side of Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA , and on September 12 , 1570 , suddenly attacked the camp of Nobunaga , who was attacking the Miyoshi clan . 
Responding to this , Monto rose in revolt around the nation , and the uprising by Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima in Ise Province ( Nagashima Ikko-Ikki ) brought down Kokie Castle in Owari Province . 
Although Kennyo and Nobunaga concluded agreements a few times after that , Kennyo , upon request from Yoshiaki and others , violated the agreements several times , which caused most Ikko-Ikki other than Ishiyama , such as Nagashima or Echizen , to be ended by mass executions by Nobunaga . 
In 1580 , after they had fought for as long as 10 years in Ishiyama since the war broke out , Nobunaga accepted the agreement proposed by Emperor Ogimachi , and disarmament of Hongan-ji Temple and Kennyo 's departure from Ishiyama brought the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War to an end . 
( Later , Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI constructed Osaka Castle in the area including the site of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple . ) 
As described above , Ikko-Ikki was one of the biggest forces in Japanese society at the time and ranked with Sengoku Daimyo ( warlords ) , but all the Monto of Shinshu did not go along with this movement . 
As seen in the case of the battle between Hongan-ji Monto and Senshu-ji School Monto ( Takada Monto and Shinshu Sanmonto School ) in Echizen Province , some Shinshu sects other than Hongan-ji had a conflicting movement . 
Reconstruction in Kyoto 
In the days of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI , in 1591 , Kennyo was given land in the center of Kyoto ( Shichijo-Horikawa , Kyoto City ) and reconstructed Hongan-ji Temple . 
In 1602 , mainly due to the confrontation in the sect over the difference of views when leaving Ishiyama , and the influence of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA 's policy on religion , Kyonyo ( 1558-161 ) , Kennyo 's oldest son , was given the nearby land to the east of Hongan-ji Temple ( Shichijo-Karasuma , Kyoto City ) by Ieyasu , and built Higashi Hongan-ji Temple . 
By this incident , Hongan-ji Temple , which had the biggest religious influence at the time , was split into West ( current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School , Shinshu Kosho School , etc . ) with Junnyo ( 1577-1630 ) , Kennyo 's third son , as the 12th head-priest , and East ( current Shinshu Otani School , etc . ) with Kyonyo , the oldest son , as the 12th head-priest . 
When religions were restructured after the Meiji Restoration , and on the occasion of official registration as a religious association to Daikyoin , only the current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School applied as Jodo Shinshu and others as Shinshu , which has affected the current names . 
Furthermore , there exists a new religion related to Jodo Shinshu , which is connected to folk beliefs over a long period of history . 
Currently , it is made up of 10 schools affiliated to Jodo Shinshu sects and other schools , and as a whole sect , it has the most temples ( about 22,000 temples ) and followers among Japanese Buddhist sects . 
Shinshu Jippa ( Shinshu Kyodan Rengo ) 
Shinshu Kyodan Rengo was organized as an association of Shinshu sects to promote cooperation and coordination among the sects in 1923 , the 750th anniversary of Shinran Sho 'nin 's birth and the 700th anniversary of foundation of the religion .

Jurakudai ( or Jurakutei ) was a large residence built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in Uchino , Kyoto ( the site of the Outer Palace Precincts in Heiankyo , present-day Kamigyo Ward , Kyoto City ) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period . 
Also called Jurakutei . 
It is a kind of castle with a moat , and thus sometimes called Juraku-jo Castle . 
The construction of Jurakudai began in February 1586 , as an office and an official residence of Hideyoshi , who became Kanpaku ( chief advisor to the emperor ) , a chief councilor to the Emperor , and completed in September 1586 . 
After Hideyoshi conquered Kyushu , he moved into Jurakudai from Osaka to administer political affairs . 
On May 9 , 1588 , he was visited by Emperor Go-Yozei and entertained him in Jurakudai . 
Also , he gave an audience to Tensho Shonen Shisetsu ( Boys ' Envoys to Europe during the Tensho era ) and Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in Jurakudai . 
Jurakudai was supposedly extremely luxurious with its tiles covered with golden leaf . 
Although being called " -dai " ( meaning tei / house ) , Jurakudai was in fact a castle on a plain , since it included several enclosed areas such as a donjon with a castle tower in the center and a secondary enclosure around it , and was surrounded with a moat . 
Within Jurakudai , houses for Hideyoshi 's aides , SEN no Rikyu et al. were built . 
Kitano Tenman-gu Shrine , where the Kitano Grand Tea Ceremony was held in October 1587 , is located nearby Uchino , where Jurakudai was . 
In December 1591 , when Hideyoshi resigned as Kanpaku , his nephew Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI succeeded him as Kampaku and took over Jurakudai , at which time Emperor Go-Yozei visited again . 
In 1594 , Hideyoshi began construction of Fushimi-jo Castle for his residence after his retirement , and in 1595 , because of an adverse relationship with Hideyoshi , Hidetsugu was sent to Mt . Koya-san and then ordered to commit suicide , thereafter Jurakudai was demolished . 
Many buildings of Jurakudai were relocated into Fushimi-jo Castle , but some other buildings such as Hiunkaku of Nishi-Hongan-ji Temple , Karamon of Daitoku-ji Temple , Daimon of Myokaku-ji Temple ( Kyoto City ) , and the entrance of Hanto-in of Myoshin-ji Temple , are also reported to have been relocated from Jurakudai . 
Name 
It is known that Jurakudai was once called " Uchino Okamai " ( or Uchino no Onkamae ) during construction , which first appears in " Tamon-in Nikki " ( The Diary of Tamon-in Temple ) , in the section of February 27 , 1586 , ' the construction of Uchino Okamai began on the last 21st . ' 
The name " Juraku " began to be used after Hideyoshi came back from the Kyushu campaign . 
As to the origin of the name " Juraku , " there is a description of ' the place for gathering ( ju ) songs and dances ( raku ) for longevity ' in " Jurakudai Gyoko-ki " ( The Diary of Visit to Jurakudai ) written by Hideyoshi 's aide , Yuko OMURA , one of " Tensho-ki " ( The Diary of Tensho ) . 
Since no other sources have been found so far , historians generally believe that the term " Juraku " was created by Hideyoshi . 
Jurakudai of today 
There is no recognizable structure of Jurakudai remaining today , except that the landscape bears its mark . 
In Matsuyamachi-dori , Shimo-chojamachi-dori , Agaru , Higashi Iru , Higashihori-cho , there is a historic site supposedly of " Tsuyu-no-I , " but there is no evidence to show that it is a remnant of Jurakudai . 
In addition , there remains a garden stone supposedly contributed by Kiyomasa KATO in Bundo-cho , to the north of Kyoto City , Demizu , Day Service Center in Chiekoin-dori , Demizu-dori , Sagaru , but there is also no evidence to show that it is a remnant of Jurakudai . 
Meanwhile , names of towns such as Suhama-cho , Suhamaike-cho , Tenbinmaru-cho , Yamazato-cho , Kitanogomon-cho , Kodaiin-cho , and Higashihori-cho markedly preserve vestiges of those days . 
Also , there are many towns named after warlords who served under Hideyoshi , such as Nyosui-cho , Kodera-cho , Ukita-cho , Hidadono-cho , Tamura-Bizen-cho , Fukushima-cho , Chusho-cho , and Naoie-cho . 
There is a monument to Jurakudai to the north of Seishin Elementary School in Jofukuji-dori , Nakadachiuri-dori . 
Note that in recent investigation , remains of a moat and tiles with gold leaf have been found . 
" Nijo Shin-Yashiki " ( Hideyoshi 's before Jurakudai ) of Hideyoshi HASHIBA ( TOYOTOMI ) of Nijo-jo Castle , 
A list of castles in Japan 
The term " Shijin-so-o " refers to the topography and land physiognomy that are traditionally believed to be the best suited for the ' Four Gods ' that govern the four directions of the heavens in China , Korea and Japan . 
It is also called Shichi-so-o topography . 
The Four Gods with an ' Oryu ' ( yellow dragon ) or Kirin at their center are called the ' Go-jin ' ( Five Gods ) . 
However , the correspondence between the Four Gods and actual geography in Japan differs greatly from that in China , South Korea , and North Korea . 
China and Korea 
Shijin-so-o topography in the feng shui of China and Korea indicates the form of Zofujusui ( storing wind and collecting water ) in which the terrain is enclosed by having tall mountains at the back ( Haizan-Rinsui ) , a lake , river , or sea in the front ( Sui ) , and smaller hills or mountains ( Sa ) on both sides . 
The Four Gods in this case are as follows : the mountains in the back are Genbu ( black warrior ) ; Sui in front is Suzaku ( a red phoenix ) ; the left Sa with Genbu in the background is Seiryu ( a blue dragon ) and the right Sa is Byakko ( a white tiger ) . 
In Kyoto , Japan it was possible to have the following association : the Tanzawa Mountains in the north as Genbu , Mt . Hidari-Daimonji as Seiryusa , Arashiyama in the west as Byakkosa and Ogura-ike Pond in the south as Suzaku ; therefore , Kyoto was a land of Shijin-so-o topography exactly from the perspective of the feng shui standard . 
However , Ogura-ike Pond was completely consumed by landfills , which broke the Shijin-so-o topography of Kyoto . 
Mt . Funaoka , which once overlooked Suzaku-oji Avenue , is a little too small for Genbu . 
In the standard viewpoint of feng shui , Mt . Funaoka is interpreted as Seiho , to which Sanryu , a dragon of mountains , is headed via Genbu . 
Japan 
In modern Japan , the interpretation that the Four Gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake , ' as shown in the following table , is generally accepted . 
However , this association has not necessarily been settled since ancient times . 
The " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " is source of the theory that equates the Four Gods to ' mountain , river , road and lake . ' 
" Sakuteiki Gardening Book " explains how to create a garden , taking Shinden-zukuri ( a style of architecture for the residence of court nobles ) into consideration , in which the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' is described as the ideal basis for such a garden . 
It also explains that planting certain kinds of trees can substitute ' The Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' in the event there is no mountain , river , road and lake to represent the Four Gods . 
The interpretation that the Four Gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake ' has been generally accepted in modern Japan , since the association of Seiryu = Kamo-gawa River ( the Yodo-gawa River system ) , Byakko = Sanin-do Road , Suzaku = Ogura-ike Pond and Genbu = Mt . Funaoka was relatively successful with Heian-kyo as a model . 
In fact , " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " mentions nothing about Heian-kyo , much less the specific places of the mountain , river , road and lake . 
It is said that " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " was created at the end of the Heian period , judging by its content , which is why the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' can only date back to the end of the Heian period . 
Therefore , we need to pay attention to the fact that there is no proof of the argument based on the assumption that this theory is the ideological background for choosing the land for Heian-kyo , which was built in the late eighth century . 
Moreover , the association of mountain , river , road and lake , as allegedly done well into the Heian-kyo , has been claimed since the Edo period , which became the general interpretation later in the Meiji period . 
In fact , even though a city prior to the Edo period would have been designed to match the Shijin-so-o topography , it is very unlikely that the Four Gods were Mountain , River , Road and Lake . 
For example , in the imperial rescript , when building the capital , Heijo-kyo is described as follows : 
Right now , the place of Heijo is in accordance with the painting of four beasts ; three mountains assuage things , and turtle augury tells the same . ' 
The phrase ' accordance with the painting of four beasts ' here means Shijin-so-o topography , which confirms that during the Nara period Heijo-kyo was considered to be the place having Shijin-so-o topography . 
The location of Heijo-kyo does n't apply to a mountain , river , road and lake as described for Heian-kyo . 
However , as long as it is associated with Shijin-so-o topography it is likely that another interpretation would have been accepted during the Nara period . 
Shirin Saiyo-sho commentary in the late Kamakura period mentions that ' the central mountains are related to Genbu , and the people , panoply and oven are related to Suzaku ... , ' which shows that Suzaku was associated with ' people , panoply and oven . ' 
Moreover , " Ryueihikan " mentions that ' Winds of the Edo Castle merit the position of the world 's castle , and its land coincides with Shijin-so-o topography ' . 
The author of " Ryueihikan " , Yamon KIKUCHI , considered that Edo Castle was built on the land coinciding with Shijin-so-o topography . 
But if applying the theory that ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' , then Tokyo Bay , which is likely to be Suzaku ( god said to rule over the southern heavens ) , spreads from east to south-by-southeast , and Koshu-kaido Road , which is likely to be Byakko ( god said to rule over the western heavens ) , only stretches to the west no matter how you see them in their favor . " 
It is far-fetched to say that such geography matches the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake . ' 
Furthermore , the interpretation that Himeji Castle , Fukuyama Castle ( Bingo-no-kuni ) or Kumamoto Castle matches the Shijin-so-o topography of ' Mountain , river , road and lake ' theory emerged later . 
As for Nagoya Castle , " Kinjo-onko-roku records " mentions that ' Your great castle has roads open to four directions , and people gather from all over the world ; like the world 's castle , it places chokepoints at about 40 kilometers ; it has mountains in the east , the sea in the south , Kiso-gawa River in the northwest , and in between it installs strategic stops at a distance of about 140 kilometers ( omission ) ; lying ahead , a fort on Mt . Yagoto in the east , Saya and the armed camp in Kiyosu in the west ( omission ) ; with the castle , camps and walls , these indicate the key castle of Shijin-so-o topography . ' 
The Shijin-so-o topography described in " Kinjo-onko-roku records " is not ' mountain , river , road and lake , ' either . 
There is no concept of certain fortune on a certain direction in the feng shui of ancient China , so it is an original Japanese concept to abhor Kimon ( the direction of northeast , called an ogre gate ) and Urakimon ( the direction of southwest which is the opposite side of Kimon ) . 
In this sense , one must doubt the theory expressed in " Kamadoyama Kyuki histroy book " that Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine was made based on feng shui according to the description that Kamado-jinja Shrine was made to protect Kimon of Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine at the time of its construction . 
This is how the interpretation of Shijin-so-o topography has changed from ancient times to the early modern times , and it is believed to be unique and different from the feng shui of ancient China . 
Grand Sumo - The four tassels with different colors above the sumo ring were relics of four pillars that originally held up the roof of Kataya , indicating the Four Gods . 
Emperor Uda ( June 14 , 867 - September 8 , 931 ) , the fifty-ninth Japanese Emperor , was in power from December 9 , 887 to August 8 , 897 . 
The last name is Sadami . 
Emperor Uda was the seventh prince of Emperor Koko . 
His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi-Joo , who was the daughter of Emperor Kammu 's son , Imperial Prince Nakano . 
Although he once left the Imperial Family and was granted the surname of Genji and called MINAMOTO no Sadami , he returned to the Imperial Family on August 29 , 887 with the help of Kampaku , chief adviser to the Emperor , FUJIWARA no Mototsune , and became a prince on August 30 , 888 . 
This is strongly related to the fact that Emperor Uda was the adopted son of Naishi no Tsukasa FUJIWARA no Yoshiko , who was Mototsune 's half-sister . 
He became Emperor on November 21 , the day Emperor Koko passed away due to ill health . 
The first child , Imperial Prince Atsugimi ( later called Emperor Daigo ) , was the son of Nyogo ( Empress Dowager Zo ) , FUJIWARA no Inshi ( Taneko ) . 
FUJIWARA no Inshi was one of the wives of Emperor Uda when he was young , and was a daughter of Naidaijin FUJIWARA no Takafuji . 
The Nyogo were FUJIWARA no Inshi , FUJIWARA no Onshi ( Yoshiko ) , TACHIBANA no Gishi ( Noriko ) , SUGAWARA no Enshi ( Hiroko ) and TACHIBANA no Boshi ( Fusako ) . 
FUJIWARA no Onshi ( Yoshiko ) was Mototsune 's daughter and became one of the Emperor Uda 's wives after his enthronement . 
After Nyogo FUJIWARA no Inshi died of illness , Imperial Prince Atsugimi was adopted and she became the prince 's wife when Emperor Daigo was enthroned . 
Because she lived in Higashi-Shichijo-no-Miya during the last part of her life , she was also called Higashi-shichijo-ko or Shichijo-ko . 
Shinjaku-Hosshinno was the son of TACHIBANA no Gishi ( Noriko ) , whose wife was the daughter of SUGAWARA no Michizane ; the name became apparent years later , when SUGAWARA no Michizane had a false charge brought against him . 
SUGAWARA no Enshi ( Hiroko ) was a daughter of SUGAWARA no Michizane . 
There are many princes and princesses . 
Most of Emperor Uda 's grandchildren were granted the surname Genji and left the Imperial Family . 
The Genji clan , which originated from the Emperor Uda Family , is called Uda-Genji ; those who came from the Genji group of FUJIWARA no Inshi 's daughter , Imperial Prince Atsumi , had the most power . 
MINAMOTO no Masanobu , Imperial Prince Atsumi 's son , became Sadaijin ; his daughter , MINAMOTO no Rinshi , was a wife of FUJIWARA no Michinaga and mother of Emperor Ichijo Chugu FUJIWARA no Shoshi and Kampaku FUJIWARA no Yorimichi . 
The lords of the Imperial Palace who kept their positions were the AYANOKOJI Family and the SASAKI clan , who were descendents of the Masanobu , who had originally moved to Ohmi and were indigenized and gave themselves the name SASAKI . 
Genealogy 
The Emperor appointed FUJIWARA no Tokihira and SUGAWARA no Michizane to positions of trust ( Kampyo-no-chi ) . 
The construction of the Ninna-ji Temple was ordered by Emperor Uda in 888 . 
The Imperial Throne was passed to Emperor Daigo , and later Emperor Uda became a high priest at Ninna-ji Temple . 
In the old days it was believed that Emperor Uda came to power due to his strict Buddhist belief ; however , one recent theory says the reason was that dominant political control had been taken away from the Fujiwara clan , or that it was done to stop the complaints from the royal families after Emperor Uda came into power by coming back to the Imperial Family , although he had become an allegiant ( as indicated by the retired Emperor Yozei in his remark in " Okagami ( The Great Mirror ) , " which is described below ) . 
Emperor Uda mentioned in " Kampyo-Goyuikai " / " Kampyo-no-Goyuikai ( a group of precepts for governing ) " that he was greatly shocked by the death of Udaijin , MINAMOTO no Yoshiari , which could have been one of the reasons he left the throne . 
On the other hand , the relationship with the retired Emperor Yozei was tense . 
According to an anecdotal story in " Okagami ( The Great Mirror ) , " the retired Emperor Yozei said that Emperor Uda used to serve him . It is also said to have been a big headache for the retired Emperor Uda as Emperor Yozei had tried to restore his government . 
According to the " Chousyu-ki " ( an article of June 7 , 1135 ) written during the Hoei period , when the retired Emperor Yozei had tried to enter the palace , Emperor Uda forbade the retired Emperor Yozei from entering the palace without his permission ; however , later on Emperor Uda tried to enter the palace when the Shotai-no-Hen / Shotai Incident happened , and he tried to ask Emperor Daigo to stop SUGAWARA no Michizane 's degradation , but could not do so because of the regulation that he himself had made . 
This was an example of a member of the Imperial Family who abdicated and then returned and became the Emperor because there was no one to succeed the enthronement ; it is said that the event of Emperor Uda 's enthronement could have been set up by FUJIWARA no Yoshiko and Mototsune , although Imperial Prince Motoyoshi was still alive . 
A power struggle occurred after the young Emperor Uda was enthroned , when he and Yoshitsune , who wanted control over the Emperor , fought against each other in the " Ako Affair . " 
Although the affair was settled by Emperor 's concession , the Emperor was smarter than Mototsune believed he was , and he changed the government into the " Shinse " style ; for example , he appointed SUGAWARA no Michizane to a position of trust . 
The Emperor Uda wrote " Kampyo-Goyuikai " / " Kampyo-no-Goyuikai ( a group of precepts for governing ) " and " Kampyo-gyoki ( Emperor Uda 's Diary ) . " 
It is said that the Emperor Uda took actual control of the government while Emperor Daigo remained sick in his last years . 
Some people said that " Engi-Tenryaku-no-chi , " which was supposed to be governed well by Emperor Daigo and Emperor Murakami , should be called " Kampyo-no-chi , " since the actual politics were based on Emperor Uda 's ( priest in a high position ) style . 
There was a big waka ( Japanese poetry ) ceremony called " Teiji-in Uta-awase , " which was held after Emperor Uda came to power , thus representing the great influence of the Kokufu Bunka ( Japan 's original national culture ) . 
It is said that the name of Emperor Uda came from the place where he abdicated ( Tsuigo is sometimes considered to be a type of posthumous name , but strictly speaking these are two different names ) ; however , he spent most of the time at Ninna-ji Temple Omuro , Teijino-in and Rokujo-in ( though another theory says the reason was that Emperor Uda spent his childhood at Uda-in , which was the house of his father , Emperor Koko , when he was the Imperial Prince ) . 
He was also called Kampyo-Hoo , Teijinoin and Dajo-emperor Suzakuin .

The Imperial Mausoleum is located at Ouchiyama no misasagi , in Uda-no-tani , Narutaki , Ukyo-ku , Kyoto City .

The Sumitomo Family is the founding family of Sumitomo Zaibatsu . 
Origin of the Sumitomo Family : Earliest ancestor , progenitor , and business founder 
Earliest ancestor of the Sumitomo Family 
The surname of Sumitomo originates from Kotaro ( Tadashige ) , the twenty-second-generation descendant of Takamochi-oh , a great grandson of Emperor Kanmu , who took the surname " Sumitomo " after the surname and given name of his father , Masami Hirauchi Tomosada , who lived at the end of the Sengoku period ; and Kotaro served Shogun Muromachi and was appointed as the Bichumori guard . 
The ancestors of the Sumitomo Family , who were Sengoku samurai and descendants of Heike , lived during the tumultuous period of Japanese history known as the Sengoku period ( Period of Warring States ) , when warriors fought each other in order to expand their lands . 
The " earliest ancestor , " Tadashige SUMITOMO , who served Shogun Muromachi , had a son called Yorisada who served Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA , and Yorisada 's son Sadanobu called himself Osakabe-sho . 
Moreover , Sadanobu 's son Sadashige served Yoshitada IMAGAWA ( the grandfather of Yoshimoto IMAGAWA ) . After the Imagawa clan was destroyed during Nobusada 's lifetime , Sadashige 's son served Kiyohide NAKAGAWA in Settsu , calling himself the guardian of Irie Tosanokami . He was known as one of the " sixteen horses of Nakagawa " , but died during the Battle of Ozaki . 
Then , Irie Tosanokami guard ( Nobusada ) ' s son Masatoshi served the Shibata clan in Echizen-no-kuni , called himself the Wakasamori guard ; he was stationed in Echizen-Maruoka-jo Castle but died in Hokujo-jo Castle together with Katsuie SHIBATA . 
Masatoshi 's son Nagamichi was employed by Hideyasu YUKI , who was a son of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and was adopted as a son-in-law by the Yuki Family , thus ending the history of the Sumitomo as a Samurai family . 
Nagamichi , who might have felt the severity and heartlessness of the ups and downs of the society of samurai families ( although that was the way of Sengoku ) , ordered his children to leave the world of samurai families . 
The first generation , Masatomo , foundation of " Fujiya " 
Nagamichi 's second son , Masatomo SUMITOMO , who had inherited the family estate instead of his elder brother Kobe , was born during the Tensho era , studied under Giyuishonin-Kugen ( the founder of the Nehan-shu sect ) and became a Buddhist who called himself " Monjuin Kuzen . " 
Masatomo , who was considered the omniscient successor of the Nehan-shu sect , returned to secular life after the Nehan-shu sect was absorbed into the Tendai-shu sect during the Kanei era and opened " Fujiya , " a business dealing with books and pharmaceuticals in Rakuchu ( called himself Kakyu ) , and started a hardworking life . 
This marked the beginning of the Sumitomo Family as merchants . 
Masatomo wrote instructions pertaining to business in " Monjuin 's Directions , " which remains the prototype for company codes in each company of the Sumitomo Group to the present day . 
The founder of a family and founder of the Sumitomo family business , the foundation of Senoku 
In the Sumitomo Family there are two distinctions : the " founder of a family " in the Sumitomo Family , and the " founder of a business " of the Sumitomo Family . 
Masatomo SUMITOMO ( the founder of a family ) , who was called Kakyu , had one son and one daughter : the son Seii inherited " Fujiya " ; the daughter . 
Riemon Soga , who was the husband of Kakyu 's elder sister and a dealer in copper who believed in the Nehan-shu sect and was a Buddhist parishioner of Ku-zen ( Masatomo ) , gave Masatomo material and mental support when Masatomo returned to the secular life and opened " Fujiya . " 
The eldest son of Riemon SOGA ( the founder of a business ) , Riemon Tomomochi ( Tomomochi SUMITOMO ) was adopted by the Sumitomo Family , which turned out to be an encounter of the Sumitomo Family with copper . 
He is the ninth generation of Tadashige . 
Thereafter , the Sumitomo Family lived in Osaka and ran a business as copper merchants for generations using the name " Senoku . " 
Nanban-fuki , a method of refining copper 
The Sumitomo Family is closely connected with copper refining , which began in the year 19 of Tensho when Riemon learned the refining method used to separate silver from crude copper , which was called the " Nanban-fuki copper refining method " by Hakusui of Minjin ( from Min ) , who had come to Senshu-Sakaiura . 
At that time it was n't known in Japan that gold , silver and the like were contained in crude copper , nor was the refining technique for separating gold and silver known . 
Riemon learned from Hakusui of Minjin the refining method and kept it secret , and thanks to the Nanban-fuki copper refining method the Sumitomo Family gained enormous profit by extracting silver from crude copper . 
The Besshidozan copper mine 
Excavation at the Besshidozan copper mine in Iyo was started in the 4th year of Genroku , which was during the lifetime of Tomoyoshi SUMITOMO , a grandchild of Riemon Tomomochi SUMITOMO . 
This developed into a mine that boasted the world 's greatest copper production , supporting Japan as an important export item and serving as the major Sumitomo business for approximately 280 years . 
The foundation of today 's Sumitomo Family , or the starting point of Sumitomo Zaibatsu , can be said to have been built by the Besshidozan copper mine that Tomoyoshi SUMITOMO developed ; and in fact , in the history of the Sumitomo Family , the fourth-generation kichizaemon Tomoyoshi is considered to be the " restorer of the Sumitomo Family . " 
During the Meiji era the Sumitomo family was engaged in cultural enterprises , and the fifteenth-generation kichizaemon Tomoito SUMITOMO donated the building that would become the Osaka Prefectural Nakanoshima Library . 
Tomoito 's son , the sixteenth-generation kichizaemon Tomonari SUMITOMO , was also a Araragi-ha poet and was on close terms with Mokichi SAITO and Jun KAWADA ( who was also an executive at the Sumitomo main office ) . 
Incidentally , it was from the third-generation head of the Sumitomo family , Tomonobu SUMITOMO ( son of Tomomochi ) , that the heads of the Sumitomo family began calling themselves " Kichizaemon . " 
The Sumitomo Family in Sumitomo Zaibatsu 
The Sumitomo Family in Sumitomo Zaibatsu , specifically since Tomoito SUMITOMO , took the position , " ( He ) reigns but does not govern . " 
All the duties of the successive Kichizaemon as president of the zaibatsu ( main company ) are the repository of trust in the head of the directors of the main Sumitomo company ( Sumitomo Limited Partnership Corporation ) ; therefore , the successive Kichizaemon did not give any specific orders to the individual businesses . 
Additionally , although Kanichi and Moto , who were brothers of the sixteenth-generation Kichizaemon Tomonari , were stockholders of the Sumitomo main company , they were never named as executives of the main company or any of its subsidiary companies . 
In this respect the Sumitomo Family can be said to be in contrast with the Mitsui and Iwasaki families . 
This tendency has in fact existed since the Edo period ( there were many cases where family heads were not engaged in management because they were in infancy or in poor health , or for other reasons , and consequently the so-called " ohbanto " would control the business ) . 
Since the Meiji era , when the Companies Act was established on one hand while , on the other hand , Tomoito SUMITOMO ( who had no experience as a businessman since he was from the Miyatake Family of old court nobility ) became the family head , this tendency became more prominent . 
However , this does not mean there was any kind of tension between the Zaibatsu Family and executives of the Zaibatsu main company or the subsidiary companies , as the Mitsui Zaibatsu had . 
As symbolized by the fact that Kichizaemon was called " Kacho-sama , " extremely high respect was accorded to the Kichizaemon , from the high-ranking position of head of the directors down to the rank and file , and the successive Kichizaemon elevated the Sumitomo name through the cultural enterprise on one hand while on the other hand trying to raise the corporate morale as the family head and president of the Zaibatsu main company . 
Designation of the Zaibatsu family 
In November 1947 , in an effort to disperse the power to control business by the Zaibatsu family and to break up the human relationships , the Zaibatsu family was designated and " zaibatsu douzoku shihairyoku haijo hou ' 48 [ Law for the Termination of Zaibatsu Family Control ] was established . 
The Holding Company Liquidation Commission , in accordance with the order by the forces of the Allied Occupation , selected the standards by which to determine the scope of the Zaibatsu family as follows : 
Ancestry within the third degree using the surnames of the Zaibatsu family and their families ( excluding by marriage ) 
One million yen or more as the total of securities , cash , deposits and savings . 
The established minimums were 500 tsubo ( approx . 1,600 square meters ) in houses , 2,000 tsubo ( approx . 6,500 square meters ) in housing land , and 50 cho ( approx . 120 acres ) of agricultural and / or forest land . 
A stockholder who would have a stake of 10 % or more of stocks issued by the company in question . 
The power to control the business or influence management 
According to the above-mentioned standards , in February 1947 the following people among the Sumitomo Family were designated as the Zaibatsu family : 
The sixteenth-generation , Tomonari SUMITOMO 
Kanichi SUMITOMO 
Yoshiteru SUMITOMO 
Moto SUMITOMO 
Relatives and Marriages of the Sumitomo Family 
Hereinafter the Sumitomo Family since the Meiji era , as well as their relatives and marriages , will be described . 
At the beginning of the Meiji era , the Sumitomo enterprise was run by Kichizaemon Tomochika ( the twelfth-generation Kichizaemon ) and his son Kichizaemon Tomotada ( the thirteenth-generation Kichizaemon ) . Misfortune struck the Sumitomo family , however , with the passing of their male heirs when Tomochika and then Tomotada died in 1890 . 
At that time the sorinin of the Sumitomo Family , Saihei HIROSE , and the manager of the Osaka main office , Teigo IBA , decided that Tomochika 's wife Toku would succeed to the name of the fourteenth-generation Kichizaemon on one hand and that Takamaro TOKUDAIJI , from the Seiga Family , would be adopted as son-in-law to marry Tomotada 's younger sister Masu , whereby the bloodline of the Sumitomo Family could be successfully maintained . 
Takamaro TOKUDAIJI became the fifteenth-generation Kichizaemon Tomoito SUMITOMO , as a brother of Sanetsune TOKUDAIJI and Kinmochi SAIONJI . 
In fact , during the Edo period the imperial bloodline of the Emperor Higashiyama was adopted by the Tokudaiji Family of the Seiga Family , and therefore the Sumitomo Family was entitled to the status of baron because the fifteenth-generation kichizaemon Tomoito was exchanged to the imperial bloodline of the early-modern history when traced back according to the male line . 
( Family line according to male line : Higashiyama Emperor - Kanin-no-miya Imperial Prince Naohito - Sukehira TAKATSUKASA - Masahiro TAKATSUKASA - Masamichi TAKATSUKASA - Kinito TOKUDAIJI - Tomoito SUMITOMO ) 
Tomoito SUMITOMO and his wife Masu , who was Tomochika 's eldest daughter , had four sons ( the third son died while still a child ) and one daughter . 
However , since the eldest son , Kanichi , was disinherited , the second son , Atsushi , became head of the Sumitomo family , adopting the name Kichizaemon Tomonari to become the sixteenth-generation Kichizaemon . 
Kichizaemon Tomonari SUMITOMO married Haruko , a second daughter of the duke Hachiro SAIONJI , the former Togu-shoku Goyo-gakari ( Kinmochi SAIONJI 's daughter 's husband , the eighth son of the duke Motonori MORI , a feudal lord of old Nagato-no-kuni , of the Domain of Yamaguchi ( Domain of Choshu ) ) . 
Tomonari and Haruko , as husband and wife , had no sons but had two daughters ; the first daughter , Kuniko , married Ikumi ( a science faculty professor at Tokyo University ) , who was the first son of Yukisada SASAKI , a former marquess who had served in the position of the former Isejingu Daiguji . 
The former marquess Yukisada SASAKI , an authority on Kokushi ( national history ) , was appointed as head of Koten Kokyujo and president of Kokugakuin University in 1942 , and then served as the president of Kokushi-henshu-in , Guji of Tokyo Daijingu in 1946 and Daiguji of Ise Jingu in 1951 . 
Yukisada 's grandfather Takayuki SASAKI was privy councilor and a head of education for Harunomiya ( Taisho Emperor ) . 
On the other hand , Tomonari and Haruko 's second daughter Hiroko married Naoyuki ( Mitsui Fudosan Co . , Ltd . ) , the second son of Masao ANZAI , who was formerly the president of Showa Denko K.K. 
Naoyuki 's elder brother , in other words Masao 's first son Takayuki ANZAI ( the president of the former Showa Engineering Co . , Ltd . ) , married Emiko , who was the second daughter of Hidezaburo SHODA , who was the president of the former Nisshin Seifun Group Inc . ( the head office of which is now Nisshin Seifun Group Inc . ) . 
Because Emiko 's elder sister , or SHODA 's first daughter , is Michiko ( of the Imperial Family ) , the Sumitomo Family is related by marriage to the Imperial Family through the Anzai and Shoda families . 
Moreover , because the person who married Naoyuki ANZAI 's younger sister Kimiko was Kensuke HOTTA ( Sumitomo Bank ) , the first son of Shozo HOTTA , who was Sodanyaku of Sumitomo Bank , Shozo HOTTA , who was the former Iincho of the Sumitomo family council after Shigeru OKAHASHI became related by Keibatsu , there was a Keibatsu blood connection to the Sumitomo Family through the Sodanyaku of Sumitomo Bank , at the soriji rank . 
Hachiro Saionji 's third son , Fujio SAIONJI , married the eldest daughter of Yoshisuke AYUKAWA and became the president of Nissan Kogyo K.K. , a subsidiary company of the Nissan Konzern Company Group . 
Kinkazu SAIONJI , who was a former member of the House of Councilors and worked to improve ties between China and Japan , is the eldest son of Hachiro SAIONJI and the eldest brother of Haruko and Fujio . 
Tomonari SUMITOMO 's elder sister Takashi married Tadateru , the third son of Viscount Tadabumi TORI , who was the feudal lord of the domain of the former Mibu ( 30,000 koku ) ; consequently , Tadateru changed his name to Tadateru SUMITOMO through his adoption as a son-in-law by the Sumitomo Family . 
Tomonari SUMITOMO 's younger brother , Moto SUMITOMO , married Sueko , the seventh daughter of Earl Tadaie SAKAI , who was the feudal lord of the domain of the former Obama ( 14,000 koku ) . 
Sueko 's elder sister , Kaeko , married the former earl Yorihiro MATSUDAIRA ( Riji of Hongo Gakuen ) , who was the descendant of the feudal lord of the domain of the former Takamatsu . 
Sueko 's elder sister , Saeko , married a grandchild of Yataro IWASAKI , the founder of Mitsubishi Zaibatsu , and her daughter Yuriko ( niece of Sueko ) married Kiyotaka CHINZEI ( professor emeritus at Kyoto University ) , who was included on a list of important figures as a doctor ( science ) of paleontology . 
Yuriko 's elder brother and a nephew of Sueko , Yasuhide IWASAKI ( the great-grandchild of Yataro and a professor emeritus at Kumamoto University ) was , like CHINZEI , a paleontologist and a doctor of science . 
Tomonari 's elder brother , Kanichi SUMITOMO , was born on May 23 , 1896 . 
As mentioned above , since he devoted himself to painting when he was young , he lost his right to inheritance , and thereafter he lived as a painter and art collector and was on close terms with Ryusei KISHIDA . 
Nearly all the Chinese calligraphy and paintings in the possession of Senoku-hakuko-kan are from Kanichi 's collection . 
The tearoom of " Murakami-tei , " which is designated as an important building of the Kamakura City landscape , was transferred from Kanichi 's house in Kamakura . 
Kanichi and his wife , a daughter of Munemitsu MINAGAWA , had four sons and two daughters . 
Their eldest son , Tsutomu SUMITOMO , served as president of the former Sumitomo Business Consulting and Sumitomo Australia Development . 
Yoko , the wife of Tsutomu SUMITOMO 's eldest son Susumu ( NEC Corporation ) , is the second daughter of Tokuro IWASE , who is president of Toso Sangyo Co . Ltd . 
Tokuro IWASE 's father , Tokusaburo , was president of the former Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co . , Ltd . 
The eldest daughter of Tokuro IWASE married Kenzaburo , who was adopted by the eleventh-generation Shichi-zaemon MOGI , a member of the Kikkoman ( Corporation ) family . 
Meanwhile , Tsutomu SUMITOMO 's younger sister Fumiko married Yoshio MIWA , president of the former Mitsuwa Soap Corporation , and Yoshio 's younger sister Satoko married Saheiji MOGI , the tenth president of the former Kikkoman Corporation . 
As a result , the family of Kanichi SUMITOMO , who was a brother of the Kichizaemon , was related to the Mogi Family by marriage twice over . 
Tsutomu SUMITOMO 's younger brother Masaru married Momoe , a daughter of Hachiro ASANO , the president of the former Kanto Denko . 
Hachiro ASANO is the third son of Souichiro ASANO , who was the second-generation sosui of Asano Zaibatsu . 
The second-generation Souichiro 's wife , Chiyoko , is a daughter of Taisuke ITAGAKI , a politician who led Jiyu Minken Undo , the Democratic Rights Campaign . 
The family head 's younger brother Moto was born on January 1 , 1912 . 
He graduated from the Kyoto University Department of Physics in 1936 , and started working for Sumitomo Metal Industries , Ltd . , in 1946 . 
He became the research chief of the Technical Department of Seikosho , the technical manager of Seikousho , the deputy head of Seikousho for Tomonari and a research manager at the same time ; subsequently , he was the vice head of Chuo Gijutsu Kenkyusho , Chuo Technical , and then became the Torishimariyaku head of Chuo Gijutsu Kenkyusho , Chuo Technical Laboratory , in November 1962 , became Jomu , and then took the position of Senmu in November 1970 , Sodanyaku and chairman of Sumitomo Precision Products Co . , Ltd. in November 1972 . 
Moto SUMITOMO 's eldest son , Yoshio SUMITOMO , is also a doctor of engineering , having graduated from the Osaka University graduate school 's doctoral course in basic engineering ; however , since his uncle , family head Kichizaemon SUMITOMO , had no legitimate son to be an heir , Yoshio was adopted by the family head Kichizaemon . 
As mentioned above , the Sumitomo Family had a close Keibatsu blood connection with former nobility over the two generations , starting with the previous generation . 
Speaking of the connection with the former noble , in addition to the descendant of Kanichi , the elder brother of the family head Kichizaemon , Mitsuko , who was the wife of the fourth child Toru , was a daughter of the former duke Hiromichi TAKATSUKASA . 
The Takatsukasa family is the highest-ranking regent family of all the court noble families , and has a close connection with the Tokudaiji and Saionji families . 
For example , Kinto TOKUDAIJI , the father of the family head ( two generations ago ) Tomoito SUMITOMO , Duke Kinmochi SAIONJI and Duke Sanetsune TOKUDAIJI , who was the former grand chamberlain , was adopted from the Takatsukasa Family by the Tokudaiji Family . 
Moreover , as Sanetsune TOKUDAIJI 's eldest daughter Junko married Hiromichi TAKATSUKASA ( an army major-general and the grand chamberlain ) , the father of Nobusuke TAKATSUKASA , the Takatsukasa and Tokudaiji families have a finely meshed pattern of strong blood connections . 
As mentioned above , the Sumitomo Family has a family line with a close Keibatsu , Keibatsu blood connection with former nobles , particularly the highest-ranking sekke--the Seiga Family--and if the Sumitomo Family is the western yokozuna among the old Zaibatsu , the Sumitomo Family also has a close connection with the Mitsui Family , the eastern yokozuna . 
In the Naramitsu Family , the younger sister of Masu was the wife of Motoito SUMITOMO , married Takayasu MITSUI ( Morinosuke ) , who was the president of the former Mitsui & Co . , Ltd . , and the eighth-generation family head of the " Mitsui-Nagasakacho Family , " which was one of the Eleven Families of Mitsui . 
It is said that when Naramitsu married into the Mitsui Family , seven freight cars were hired to send wedding dresses from Osaka to Tokyo . 
Moreover , since Takayasu MITSUI 's eldest son Takaatsu ( the torishimariyaku of Mitsui & Co . , Ltd . ) married Reiko , who was younger sister of Hachiroemon MITSUI , the tenth-generation Hokke , being the Mitsui Soryo-ke family and heir , the Keibatsu , Keibatsu blood connection between the Sumitomo and Mitsui families is not only a simple bond between one family and another family but is also a genuine connection directly connecting the Honke and Soryo-ke families and heirs . 
However , the connection with the Mitsui Family is not only as mentioned above . 
Tomoko , who was the third daughter of Duke Sanetsune TOKUDAIJI , who is the elder brother of the former generation of Kichizaemon , married Koju MITSUI of the Mitsui-Muromachi Family ; and because Tsuruko , who was the eldest daughter of the former baron Norimaro Tokudaiji , who was the third son of Sanetsune and started the branch family , that is , the granddaughter of Sanetsune married Takanao MITSUI of the Mitsui-Shinmachi Family , which means Honke of the Sumitomo Family and Honke of the Mitsui Family have quadruple or quintuple Keibatsu , Keibatsu blood connections . 
Moreover , the former viscount Tadakazu TORI , who was the elder brother of Tadateru--a husband of the elder sister of the head of family Kichizaemon--married Hiroko , who was the eldest daughter of Hachiro-jiro , the eighth-generation Mitsui-Minami Family . 
The Sumitomo Family has extensive connections by marriage with former nobles , particularly with the above-mentioned court noble families , as well as with five of the eleven Mitsui families ( including the Mitsui Soryo-ke family and the heir ) ; namely , the Hokke , Nagasakacho , Muromachi , Minami , and Shinmachi families . 
Shido-sai 
Every year on April 25 , presidents , chairpersons and sodanyaku of direct affiliates of the Sumitomo Group gather to attend the " Shido-sai " held in " Ariyoshi-en , " which was historically a Sumitomo-ke Bettei in Shishigadani in Kyoto Higashiyama , where " Gozan-no-okuribi " is performed . 
There is a small shrine called " Hosendo " in a corner of Ariyoshi-en , which covers an area of approximately 9,900 square meters . 
The year 1940 was the one in which the celebration of the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese nation was held , but this year was also the 250th anniversary of the opening of the Besshidozan copper mine ; and to enshrine the souls of the deceased successive Sumitomo family heads and the deceased executive officers of the old Sumitomo Honsha this shrine was designed by Eikichi HASEBE and built as a refined space where the tablets of the above-mentioned deceased people are enshrined . 
The people who are allowed to attend " Shido-sai " are limited to those who are related to the Sumitomo Family and members of " Hakusui-kai , " which is a group for the presidents of direct affiliates of the Sumitomo Group and graduates of Hakusui-kai ( former presidents ) . 
That is , " Shido-sai " is a day on which the family head of the Sumitomo Family and the highest-ranking executive officers such as presidents , chairpersons and sodanyaku of direct affiliates of the Sumitomo Group gather once a year for the " memorial service for the deceased . " 
Incidentally , April 25 is the death day of Riemon SOGA , the " founder of business . " 
Each year Shido-sai is organized by a company that is a member of " Hakusui-kai , " the order being established by rotation .

Amanohashidate is a scenic spot in Miyazu Bay , near Miyazu City in Kyoto Prefecture . 
Amanohashidate is a sand spit ( geologically , a sand bar ) 3.2km long ( Daitenkyo , Shotenkyo ) , lined with about 7,000 pine trees , and ranging in width from 20m to 170m at its base . 
It stretches from Miyazu Bay to the Aso Sea . 
Miyazu Bay opens into the Aso Sea via Monju-no-kirido and Monju-no-suiro . 
The name can also refer to the area including Kasamatsu Park , which has a view of Amanohashidate . 
Daitenkyo and Shotenkyo are connected by a drawbridge ( in the picture on the right , between the land in the foreground and the sand spit ) , below which tour boats and other small boats pass . 
It got its name from the fact that if you look at it upside-down , it looks like a bridge across the sky . 
The name came from people looking through their legs from Kasamatsu Park on the north side , a view that is traditionally considered very beautiful ( the view from Kasamatsu Park is also called a " slanted number 1 " ) . 
The view from the south side ( and that from vantage point ) , called " flying dragon " ( Hiryukan . 
Because it looks like a dragon climbing into the sky ) , is also popular , drawing just as many tourists as the north side . 
There are other vantage points : the view from the east side is called Sesshukan ( 
from " Amanohashidate-zu " by Sesshu , shown at left ) ; and the view from the west is called " Ichijikan " ( 
Because it looks like the kanji character for 1 , or ichi ) . 
Since it has been famous from ancient times , examples can be found in literature , such as the poem by KOSHIKIBU no Naishi in the Hyakunin-isshu , " By Mt . Oe the road to Ikuno is long , I have not yet seen Amanohashidate " ; and in the Tango no Kuni Fudoki it is written that Izanagi had a ladder to climb to heaven , but it fell over while he was sleeping and became Amanohashidate . 
Since the Edo period it has been counted as one of Japan 's three scenic views , along with Matsushima ( current Miyagi Prefecture ) and Miyajima ( current Hiroshima Prefecture ) . 
On November 22 , 1952 , it was designated by the national government as a place of special scenic beauty , and has also been selected as one of the top 100 white sand beaches and green pine groves of Japan ( Hakushaseisho Hyakusen ) . 
Although it was designated a part of the Wakasa Bay Quasi-National Park on June 1 , 1955 , it indepedently became Tango-Amanohashidate-Oeyama Quasi-National Park on August 3 , 2007 . 
In 2007 it was selected as one of Japan 's top 100 geological features ( Chishitsu Hyakusen ) . 
Kyoto Prefecture and Miyazu City have made suggestions to the Agency for Cultural Affairs as candidate for the tentative ( UNESCO ) World Heritage Site list , and named their suggestion " Amanohashidate : The Origin of Japan 's Cultural Scenery " .

Amanohashidate has shrunk in recent years due to erosion , and is in danger of disappearing . 
This is because dams were built on the rivers after the war , reducing the amount of sediment carried from the mountains to the sea , and destroying the balance of sediment deposits and erosion on Amanohashidate . 
To prevent further erosion , the administration has installed many small erosion barriers on the sand bar in an attempt to stop the sand from washing away ( in the picture from the south ( Hiryukan ) , it is the part on the right where the beach is serrated ) . 
At one time the trees were blighted by pine weevils , and were in danger of being wiped out . 
Since then a pest eradication program has been implemented and the problem is currently in abatement .

Muromachi Bakufu was a samurai government established by Takauji ASHIKAGA . 
It was Japan 's second Bakufu government , following the Kamakura Bakufu . 
The name ' Muromachi ' was derived from the Muromachi-dono , which was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , the third Ashikaga Shogun , to serve as the public residence of the Shogun ( commonly known as Hana no Gosho , this residence is located in what is now Kamigyo Ward , Kyoto City ) . 
There are two views regarding the year of Muromachi Bakufu 's establishment--in November 1336 , when the administrative policies of Bakufu were set up ( being clearly indicated as Kenmu Shikimoku ) , or in 1338 , when Takauji ASHIKAGA was assigned as Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) by Emperor Komyo of Jimyoin-to faction ( 持明院統 ) ; however , the former view is more convincing . 
Regarding the time when the bakufu ended , it virtually ended in 1573 when the fifteenth shogun , Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA , was banished from Kyoto by Nobunaga ODA . 
The period of slightly more than 240 years between the beginning and the end is called the Muromachi period . 
Furthermore , the period until the unification of Hokucho and Nancho is called the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , and the period after the Onin War ( 1467 ) or the Meio Incident ( 1493 ) is called the Age of Civil War ( Japan ) . 
Because procedures for the removal of Seii Taishogun were not implemented even after Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA 's banishment from Kyoto , he was still treated as a shogun by the powers opposed to Nobunaga . 
" Kugyo-Bunin " treated Yoshiaki as a Shogun until February 9 1588 , when he followed Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI , chief adviser to the Emperor , and visited the Imperial Palace , vowed loyalty to Hideyoshi and was granted status as Ju-sangu . 
Also , according to the official opinion of the government at the time , from the end of the Meiji period until defeat in World War II , Nancho ( Japan ) was regarded as the legitimate imperial line , and this age was referred to as the ' period of the Northern and Southern Courts ( Japan ) ' ; because of such a view , the first shogun Takauji , the second shogun Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA and the third shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA were not acknowledged as official shoguns ( based on imperial history ) . 
The staff organization of Muromachi Bakufu is more or less adapted from the organization of Kamakura Bakufu . 
As for law , Takauji enacted Kenmu Shikimoku as a basic law ( in 1336 ) . 
As a detailed law , Goseibai-shikimoku ( Joe-shikimoku ) of the Kamakura period was applied , and when necessary an additional law called ' Kenmu-irai-tsuika ' was issued to supplement the above . 
Government during the initial period was unstable , partly because Nancho still existed . 
Also , a government structure was assigned with the shogun at the top , along with Samurai-dokoro , government office , monchu-jo , hyojo-shu , hikitsuke-shu as the control with the role of supporting the shogun . 
Muromachi Bakufu was a united government of Shugo daimyos , and the control originating from the chamberlain position of the Ashikaga clan did not have the actual power that the regents of Kamakura Bakufu had ; consequently , government by bakufu was in principle conducted through a council system . 
The major Shugo daimyos referred to as Sankan--the Hosokawa clan , Shiba clan and Hatakeyama clan--assumed the position of control and supported the Shogun , while the Akamatsu clan , Isshiki clan , Yamana clan and Kyogoku clan , as Shishiki , assumed by turns the position of Shoshi , the chief of Samurai-dokoro . 
Major posts of the bakufu and shugos governing several lands were held by the Ashikaga family such as the Hosokawa clan , Shiba clan , Yamana clan , Isshiki clan , Hatakeyama clan , Shibukawa clan , Imagawa clan , Uesugi clan ( cognate ) , etc . 
Also , Hoko-shu was formed as the military power directly under the control of the shogun . 
Successive Shoguns : A List of Ashikaga Shoguns 
The collapse of the public ownership system of manors = transfer to the system of ownership by Shugo daimyos and the development of a monetary economy are part of the characteristics of Muromachi Bakufu . 
In the Kamakura period , individual Gokenin directly paid homage to the Shogun ( although there were exceptions such as being hired by a strong Gokenin ) , and shugos were mere supervisors of Gokenin within their lands . 
However , during the Muromachi period the Shugo daimyos directly hired samurais in their lands , who became their vassals , and exercised unified control over their lands ( since there are exceptions or differences by region , please refer to the item ' System of Ownership by Shugo Daimyos ' for details ) . 
Subsequently , even Shugo daimyos with power exceeding that of Shogun Muromachi were born . 
Against such circumstances , Shogun Muromachi hired samurais of various regions over the Shugo daimyos ' heads , and formed ' Hoko-shu ' as mentioned above , which not only strengthened the direct military power of the shogun but also deterred the control of Shugo daimyos over their lands . 
However , while there were cases in which the bakufu subdued individual Shugo daimyos , there was no case where a Shugo daimyo and Shogun Muromachi were fully in conflict with each other . 
The Shugo daimyos proceeded to exercise control over their lands by the authority that they were assigned to the position of Shugo by Bakufu . 
Therefore , no matter how much they expanded their power , they could not afford to deny the authority of Shogun Muromachi . 
After all , if the authority of the Shogun were to be eroded , so too would that of the Shugo daimyo . 
There were two shoguns who were assassinated ( the sixth , Yoshinori ASHIKAGA , and the thirteenth , Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA ) . 
Also , four shoguns who died in their place of exile ( the tenth , Yoshitane ASHIKAGA ; eleventh , Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA ; twelfth , Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA ; and fourteenth , Yoshihide ASHIKAGA ) . 
Upon the occurrence of Kanno no Joran , Takauji ASHIKAGA established the Kamakura government in Kamakura as an organization to control 10 countries in the east . 
The position as chief of this organization was succeeded by the descendant of Motouji ASHIKAGA , a son of Takauji , who served the position of Kanto control ( 関東管領 ) . 
Throughout the Muromachi period , Kamakura-kubo ( 鎌倉公方 ) was opposed to bakufu and also became gradually opposed to the Uesugi clan , who held the position of Kanto control . 
To compete with such power , Bakufu directly hired strong local persons in the land of Kanto and Mutsu , as Kyoto Fuchi-shu . 
Consequently , in the era of Yoshinori ASHIKAGA the fourth Kamakura-kubo , Mochiuji ASHIKAGA , who raised the Eikyo Rebellion , was conquered and temporarily direct rule by the shogun was exercised but eventually failed ; subsequently , Mochiuji 's son Shigeuji ASHIKAGA was made the new Kamakura-kubo . 
However , Shigeuji also raised the Kyotoku Rebellion and escaped to Koga-jo Castle , where he named himself Koga-kubo ( 古河公方 ) , and as the Uesugi clan split into the Yamanouchi Uesugi and Ogigayatsu Uesugi families , the Kanto region was in a state of turbulence before the Onin War started . 
Bakufu refused to simply wait with its arms folded but instead sent the younger brother of the eighth shogun , Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , Masatomo ASHIKAGA , to Kanto ( Horikoshi-kubo ( 堀越公方 ) ) . 
However , Horikoshi-kubo was also defeated after Masatomo 's death by Moritoki ISE ( Soun HOJO ) , a major vassal of the Imagawa clan , and this ended in failure . 
Also , Koga-kubo , after splitting off Oyumi-kubo ( 小弓公方 ) , was made a puppet of the Go-Hojo clan , who were descendants of Moritoki . 
In Kyushu , Kyushu Tandai , headquartered in Hakata ( Fukuoka City , Fukuoka Prefecture ) , was established . 
Initially , Sadayo IMAGAWA ( Ryoshun ) , who had been ordered to subdue Nancho powers such as Imperial Prince Kanenaga , assumed the position , but the Bakufu feared that Ryoshun would establish his own power in Kyushu ; after Ryoshun was dismissed , descendants of the Shibukawa clan succeeded in the position . 
In the Tohoku Region Oshu control ( 奥州管領 ) was established , which was abolished when two countries of Ou became under the control of Kamakura-fu , and during a certain period Inamura-kubo ( 稲村公方 ) and Sasagawa-kubo ( 篠川公方 ) were established . 
Oshu Tandai ( 奥州探題 ) was established during the era of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , and Iekane SHIBA was assigned . 
Ushu Tandai ( 羽州探題 ) split after the death of Iekane , and the Shiba clan of Dewa became the Mogami clan . 
Upon the abasement of the Shogun 's authority after the Onin Rebellion , Sankan Shishiki ( other than the Hosokawa clan ) also fell , and when in the middle of the Age of Civil War the power of the Hosokawa clan weakened , the various systems of Muromachi Bakufu became mere terms . 
Meanwhile , the regional ruling classes called Kokujin ( 国人 ) gained power . 
In the southern part of Yamashiro Province , where the Yamashironokuni Riot occurred , self-government ( in addition to regional ruling classes , farmers , etc . ) also participated . 
Such Kokujin powers were regrouped / merged and developed into strong warring lordships , which competed with each other and grew in power ; they replaced government by Bakufu and gave rise to the trend of civil war that followed . 
The majority of the financial income of Muromachi Bakufu came from Goryo-sho ( 御料所 ) , which was directly controlled by Bakufu ; but often , during the war of the Northern and Southern Courts , the Goryo-sho became a target and were taken by the opposing Nancho side , or were given away as rewards for one 's own army , and the scale of Goryo-sho is considered to be smaller than that of Kamakura Bakufu or Edo Bakufu . 
Additionally , Tansen ( 段銭 ) and Munabetsu-sen ( 棟別銭 ) , etc . , were charged . 
Operating taxes , etc . , were collected from merchants in exchange for the special privileges and protection provided to them , and Tsuryou ( 津料 ) was charged from various ports and Sekisen ( tolls ) from barriers . 
Furthermore , when a permanent right to charge Yakusen ( 役銭 ) from Doso ( 土倉 ) and Sakaya ( 酒屋 ) in Kyoto was allowed during the era of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , Yakusen were charged together with Tansen , Munabetsu-sen , etc . , by the doso appointed by Bakufu , who were referred to as Nosen-kata . 
Nosen-kata were later also entrusted with clerical matters such as the safekeeping / bookkeeping of tax income , and such doso were referred to as Kubo-okura ( 公方御倉 ) . 
Furthermore , when Yoshimitsu initiated trade between Japan and Ming , profit by Chubunsen ( 抽分銭 ) also became the income of Bakufu . 
Due to the limited numbers of trade activities , they remained as income of a temporary nature , but it is said that there were cases where income from a single trade was as great as the other tax income of several years . 
Other special income included Reisen ( 礼銭 ) and Buichisen ( 分一銭 ) . 
Furthermore , since the latter half of the fifteenth century , action was taken to make the Yamashiro Province ( within Kyoto ) a Goryo-sho . 
Waka is a fixed form of poem that has been created since Jodai ( mainly the Nara period ) . 
The people who compose Waka are called Kajin poets . 
Appellation 
Waka is a name in contrast to the Chinese poetry , and it is also called Yamatouta ( 大和歌 ・ 倭歌 ) or just Uta . 
In the Nara period it was called Waka ( 倭歌 ) or Washi ( 倭詩 ) . 
In a broad sense , Waka means Choka ( long poem ) , Tanka ( short poem ) , Sedoka ( head-repeated poem ) , Katauta ( half poem ) , and Bussokusekika ( Buddha 's footprint stone poem ) , but in a narrow sense it designates only Tanka of 31 syllables . 
Therefore , it is also called Misohitomoji ( 31 syllables . ) 
Also , it is called Yakumo , the name of which is based on the first word of the poem Susanoo ( a deity in Japanese mythology ) composed , and the poem is considered the first Waka in Japanese mythology : ' Clouds ( Yakumo ) , actively upwelling covered the eightfold fence.It makes the eightfold fence to have my new wife stay in the house.Great eightfold fence . ' 
Yakumo-no-michi ' means ' Kado ( the art of Waka poetry ) . ' 
Just like ' Yakumo-no-michi , ' ' Shikishima-no-michi ( Roads in Japan ) ' means Kado . 
Shikishima means Yamato or Japan , so it literally means ' roads in Japan . ' 
It suggests that to compose poems was the Japanese traditional culture . 
Also , there is a unique form of poem called Ryuka ( Ryukyu poetry ) in Okinawa Prefecture . 
Waka means Uta ( song ) and fixed-form poetry consisting of five and seven syllables and written in Yamato-kotoba ( a word of purely Japanese origin ) . 
Waka is considered to be both literature and music , but generally it is taken as one genre of Japanese literature , so the element of ' Uta ' has been excluded in Japanese education . 
Katauta 
Tercets of five , seven and seven syllables 
It is a half-poem that is sung by one of the two people , and it is the shortest poem . 
Sedoka 
Two tercets of five , seven and seven syllables each 
It is a repeated form of Katauta , and most of the Sedoka is Mondoka ( dialogue poem ) . 
Choka 
It consists of alternating lines of five and seven syllables , and ends with an extra seven-syllable line . 
The five and seven syllables are repeated more than three times , and then seven-syllable line is added at the end . 
Choka had been seen a lot in Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , but it was not composed any more when Kokinshu ( Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern ) was compiled . 
Choka was mainly composed in public , and was followed by Hanka ( envoi ) . 
Tanka 
It consists of five lines of five , seven , five , seven and seven syllables . 
Later the form was divided into two parts ( the first part of five , seven and seven syllables , and the latter part of seven and seven syllables ) , and then Renga ( linked verse ) and Haikai ( 17-syllable verse ) were generated . 
Bussokusekika form 
It consists of six lines of five , seven , five , seven , seven and seven syllables . 
Imayo ( an ancient verse form ) 
It consists of eight lines of seven , five , seven , five , seven , five , seven and five syllables . 
It was created in the middle of the Heian period . 
Jinku poetry ( Dodoitsu ) 
It consists of four lines of seven , seven , seven and five syllables . 
It was created in the Edo period . 
It is often seen in Minyo ( folk songs ) of all areas in Japan . 
Hayashikotoba ( a meaningless refrain used to maintain the rhythm of a song ) is often inserted into it . 
It is also said that the name of Dodoitsu appeared after the last days of the Tokugawa government . 
Makura kotoba ( pillow word ) 
Jo kotoba ( introductive word ) 
Kake kotoba ( pivot word ) 
Engo ( related word ) 
Honkatori ( adaptation of a famous poem ) 
Taigendome ( noun appearing at the end of Waka ) 
Tsuiku ( couplet ) 
Kugire ( caesura ) 
Hiko is to recite Waka to a tune , and there are some schools of reciting such as the AYANOKOJI School and the REIZEI School . 
Today it is seen at the New Year Imperial Poetry Reading Party , certain events in shrines , etc . 
Before the fixed form of Waka was established , it had been called Jodai Kayo . 
It is also said that the screams and cheers let out with excitement increasingly grew to be songs sung in groups at festivals and during laborious work . 
Most of them are considered to have been lost without being written down , but about 300 poems have survived in the books of " Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) , " " Nihon shoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , " " Fudoki ( notes on local legends and geography ) , " " Manyoshu , " " Kogoshui ( commentaries on ancient words and practices ) , " " Kinkafu ( poetry collection ) " and " Bussokusekika hi ( stele ) . " 
There was a group event called Utagaki ( dancing and singing feast of young men and women ) as one of the customs in those days . 
Jodai Kayo came to be an origin of ceremonial songs such as Kagurauta ( songs ) and Saibara ( folk songs ) , which were accompanied with instruments , and its form and poetic devices became progenitors of the later Waka . 
Jodai Kayo in " Kojiki " and " Nihon shoki " were especially called Kiki kayo . 
They are not independent ballads but used to enhance an effect of narrative , and some of them are said to have been creative songs or ceremonial songs made by court people . 
Poetic devices such as Tsuiku , Kurikaeshi ( repetition ) , Makura kotoba , Jo kotoba , etc . , were used for a verse form of basic lines of five and seven syllables , like Katauta , Sedoka , Tanka and Choka . 
The other ballads in the same period were of the kind inscribed on the monument of Bussokusekika in Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara and " Kinkafu , " which was a book on the Wagon ( a Japanese string instrument , also called the Yamatogoto , that consisted of a flat , shallow sound box with six strings , much like a zither ) , was copied in the middle of the Heian period . 
In the process of giving unification to Japan , Chinese poetry was introduced to Japan from the Chinese Continent , and under its influence poems to express individual feelings were energetically composed . 
Those poems were compiled into " Manyoshu . " 
According to the notes in Manyoshu , there had been some other anthologies before Manyoshu , such as " Kokashu ( Collection of Old Poetry ) , " " KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro 's Collection , " " Kasanokanamura Collection , " " TAKAHASHI no Mushimaro 's Collection of Poetry , " " Book of poetry of TANABE no Sakimaro , " " Ruiju-karin ( Collection of Poetry ) , " etc . , but none of them has survived . 
It is said that Manyoshu was compiled by many people over a long period of time , but it was OTOMO no Yakamochi who in the end edited and made a 20-volume anthology as it is . 
Manyoshu contains about 4500 poems , the earliest of which was composed in the reign of Emperor Nintoku , but most of them were being made during the period of less than 100 years from the Asuka period to the middle of the Nara period . 
Most of the poems have realistic and objective styles , and there are some poems made by people in general , such as Azumauta poetry and Sakimori-no-uta ( frontier guards ' poems ) besides the poems of court nobles . 
During the early Heian period , Chinese poetry overwhelmed Waka as a public literature . 
Zotoka ( poems exchanged between a man and a woman ) became the leading style of Waka , and the number of Waka composed in the Imperial Court decreased compared with that of the Nara period . 
However , in the middle of the Heian period the decline of Tang and abolishment of Kentoshi ( the embassy to the Tang dynasty ) lessened the influence of Chinese culture , and Kokufu bunka was developed . 
In its process , Waka gradually regained its position as an official culture along with the development of Kana characters ( the Japanese syllabaries ) , and Uta awase ( poetry match ) came to be held . 
In the book of " Shinsen Manyoshu ( Newly Selected Manyoshu ) , " Japanese poems were put beside the Chinese poems , which suggested that the Japanese poetry was regaining its status as an official literature . 
Under such circumstances , " Kokin wakashu ( Collection from Ancient and Modern Times ) , " the first anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command , was made and offered to the emperor . 
Subsequently , Waka became a synonym for Tanka . 
" Kokin wakashu " was compiled by Imperial command of Emperor Daigo in 905 ; the compilers were KI no Tsurayuki , KI no Tomonori , OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune and MIBU no Tadamine . 
It contains about 1000 poems in 20 volumes , which were composed after " Manyoshu . " 
Intellectual and ideal styles of poetry are characteristic of this collection . 
Fifty years later , in the reign of Emperor Murakami , Wakadokoro ( Bureau of Poetry ) was established , where Nashitsubo no Gonin ( Five Men of the Pear Chamber ) read the Chinese characters in " Manyoshu , " which was already difficult to read at that time , in the Japanese pronunciation , and compiled and dedicated " Gosen wakashu ( Later Collection of Japanese Poetry ) " to the Emperor . 
Most of the poems are Zotoka written by court nobles , and there is a tendency toward narrative poems . 
More 50 years later , around the reign of Emperor Ichijo , " Shui wakashu ( Collection of Gleanings ) " was compiled and dedicated to the emperor . 
It followed a tradition of " Kokin wakashu , " which had elegant , refined styles . 
During the late Heian period , the Sekkan ( regent and chief councilor ) government began to decline , and a change occurred in the aristocratic culture . 
" Go shui wakashu ( Later Collection of Gleanings ) " was compiled around this time and was dedicated to the Emperor . 
Compared with the conservative " Go shui wakashu , " the following " Kinyo wakashu ( A Collection of Golden Leaves ) " was innovative and focused on fresh descriptive poems ; however , the subsequent " Shika wakashu ( A Collection of Verbal Flowers of Japanese Poetry ) " marked a return to the conservative style . 
After the Genpei War ( the final struggle between the Taira and Genji ( Minamoto ) clans ) , the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawain ordered FUJIWARA no Toshinari to compile " Senzai wakashu ( Collection of a Thousand Years ) . " 
It shows a tendency toward the principle of art for art 's sake in the destruction of the aristocracy and the rise of samurai warriors , elevating the status of waka in the late Heian period . 
The following " Shin kokin wakashu ( New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry ) " was compiled and dedicated to the emperor by Toshinari 's disciple . 
In the Kamakura period , court nobles who had been deprived of their power came to depend on the traditional culture , so they composed waka energetically . 
Bearing feelings of rivalry toward Kamakura , the Retired Emperor Go-Tobain who showed much enthusiasm for Waka ordered the compilation of " Shin kokin wakashu . " 
Most of the poems were not based on real experiences but on a fictional world . 
The principle of art for art 's sake , as seen in Senzai wakashu , was further refined , and poetic devices reached their culmination . 
On the other hand , the following two people were respected : Saigyo , who made poems on love toward nature and his view of life , and MINAMOTO no Sanetomo , who composed poems in the Manyo style . 
After the death of FUJIWARA no Sadaie , who had been a central figure in the compilation of " Shin kokin wakashu , " his son Tameie became a mentor of the Tanka Composers ' Society , but after Tameie passed away , both the Fujiwara family and the Tanka Composers ' Society were divided into three schools : the NIJO , KYOGOKU and REIZEI . 
The three schools struggled to attain leadership , and both the NIJO and KYOGOKU schools compiled collections of poems one after another by imperial command . 
Since around the period of the Northern and Southern Courts ( Japan ) , waka came to be composed mainly by monks and samurai , while the composition of waka spread to local samurai , and some of the waka that lapsed into formalism declined . 
In the early modern times , traditional studies of waka were compiled into a book , and many kajin poets appeared , but waka had already been perfected as ' kado , ' so a new style did not emerge . 
Compared with haikai , which had been just generated , waka was traditional Japanese culture that had continued since Jodai ( ancient times ) ; therefore , its degree of innovation was suppressed . 
At the end of the early modern times , a new movement of waka arose in Kyoto , and there appeared the Keien school of jigenin ( a court official who has not obtained the imperial ordinance of promotion ) derived from the NIJO school of dojo ( a family who is allowed to be promoted to court noble ) . 
The Keien school had been a leading school in the Tanka Composers ' Society until the early Meiji period . 
Highly educated people of the early Meiji period played important roles in the Tanka Composers ' Society , as represented by the Outadokoro School and Keien School , but people who intended waka reform ( Shiki MASAOKA , Tekkan YOSANO , and so on ) criticized both the style and elegant poetic devices of daiei ( poetry composed on a given theme ) , and thus there emerged a new style of waka suitable for the new era . 
However , in order to discern the new Waka from the traditional one , these new poems came to be commonly called ' Tanka ' ( see also Tanka ) . 
People who compose waka are called kajin poets . 
They are also called Utabito . 
See also the list of kajin poets . 
Kasei ( great poet ) is an honorific title given to a master of Waka . 
It not only shows respect to the Kajin poet but also indicates those who are treated as gods in Kado , such as KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro and YAMABE no Akahito . 
Kashu is a book in which Waka are collected . 
Chokusen wakashu ( Chokusen shu ) 
The collection was compiled by imperial order . 
Shisen wakashu ( personal collection of poetry ) , or Shisen shu 
A collection of poems compiled by individuals or nongovernmental circles 
Above all , Ogura Hyakunin isshu ( One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets ) , compiled by FUJIWARA no Sadaie , is familiar to everyone , and it has had great influence on the Japanese people 's appreciation of waka . 
Shikashu ( personal collection ) 
A collection of poems written by a single author . 
Because waka began as accompaniment to a tune , the number of letters ( the number of syllables , or mora ) is not strictly confined if it is read in a singsong manner . 
Therefore , as long as it is read in a singsong manner the poem does n't essentially seem to have ' extra syllables or insufficient syllables , ' even if it doesn 't consist of lines with five and seven syllables . 
The idea of ' extra or insufficient syllables ' arose from a sense of beauty for a fixed form of verse to write down instead of reciting it . 
In the context of Western music , waka has a slow quadruple time that establishes its rhythm in sets of two bars . 
Five syllables consists of five crotchets and three crotchet rests in one rhythm ( two bars ) , while seven syllables consists of seven crotchets and one crotchet rest in one rhythm , but if the total number of crotchets and crotchet rests is eight in one rhythm ( two bars ) , then it is acceptable ( nine syllables includes a triplet part ) . 
A verse form depends on the combination and number of the rhythm . 
For example , a Tanka is made up of five sets of two bars , giving a total number of ten bars . 
The Tanka , that ' temporary hermitage , with straw mat on the roof , in autumn rice field.My cloth would be getting wet with rain " is said to be divided into two parts of ' five , seven , six and seven , seven , ' having an extra syllable , but if the poem is divided by a set of two bars , ' Akinota ( autumn rice field ) ' is used more . 
An example of applying Western-style harmony to tanka and deserting the manner of reciting waka ( rhythm ) is ' Kimigayo ( the Japanese national anthem ) , ' and in this case the rhythm of tanka , as stated above , was abandoned in the adjustment to the Western system of harmony . 
On the other hand , ' Kojo no tsuki ( The Moon Over the Deserted Castle ) ' is an excellent piece of music that has been applied to Western-style harmony without destroying the waka rhythm of seven and five syllables . 
Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA was the 3rd Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate and reigned from 1368 to1394 . 
Official Rank : Juichii Daijodaijin ( Chancellor of the Realm ) and Zoshoichii 
Title of Nobility : Monarch of Japan 
Childhood name : Haruo 
His farther was the 2nd Shogun , Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA , and his mother was KI no Yoshiko . 
His wife was Nariko HINO , a daughter of the Dainagon ( Great Councilor ) Tokimitsu HINO , and she became his wife thanks to the arrangement and support of a beloved princess of the Emperor Go-Kogon , Senshi Hino . 
After that , Yasuko Hino ( later Kitayamain ) , her niece , became his wife after the death of Nariko . 
His concubines were FUJIWARA no Keishi ( Yoshiko ) - mother of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA and Yoshinori ASHIKAGA - and Kasuga no Tsubone ( a concubine of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA ) - mother of Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA - among others . 
Yoshimitsu was also called " Muromachi-dono " ( Lord Muromachi ) , because he moved the Imperial Palace to Kitakoji Muromachi . 
Later , " Muromachi-dono " became the designation for the ASHIKAGA Shogun , and his government office-cum-residence was called " Muromachi Bakufu , " which has been used ever since as a historical term to indicate Muromachi Shogunate . 
He was born in 1358 . 
It fell precisely on the 100th day after the death of Takauji ASHIKAGA . 
When Yoshimitsu was young , there were constant struggles between the Muromachi Shogunate and the Yoshino Imperial Court , and moreover , since the Kanno Disturbance , an internal conflict of the ASHIKAGA family , had occurred , the strife between the Shogunate and the Court intensified . 
Kiyouji HOSOKAWA and other potential military commanders supported the Southern Imperial Court , and in 1361 , when Kiyouji and Masanori KUSUNOKI of the Southern Imperial Court occupied Kyoto , Yoshimitsu was obliged to escape to the Shirahata Castle in Harima Province . 
The following year , he returned to Kyoto as the alliance of the Shogunate and Northern Court recaptured the capital . On the way back to Kyoto , when he spent a night in Settsu Province , he liked the scenery and said to the vassals , " there is very fine scenery here , let 's carry it back to Kyoto . 
" You should carry it on your shoulders , " and the vassals , listening to him , were said to be very surprised at his grandiose thinking . 
After his farther Yoshiakira died from an illness in 1367 , Yoshimitsu became the 3rd Shogun at the age of 11 . 
In 1368 the Hyojohajime was celebrated , and in 1369 he was installed as Shogun . 
While the administration of the Shogunate was led by Shugo Daimyos of the Ashikaga clan , including Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA , who were in charge of Kanrei , he studied imperial governance . 
Yoriyuki implemented Oan no Taiho , a land expropriation law , to consolidate land management , and developed the Five Mountain System in Kyoto and Kamakura to strengthen control over religion . 
He also dispatched Sadayo ( Ryoshun ) IMAGAWA and Yoshihiro OUCHI to Kyushu , where the Southern Court dominated , to debilitate its influence and consolidate the power of the Shogunate . 
In 1374 , he welcomed Yoriko HINO as his wife . 
In 1370 , in order to strengthen control over Kyoto , the Court gave him authority to control the Sanmon Kunin ( a clique of influential people of Enryaku-ji Temple and its affiliates , as well as member of the temple ) 
In 1378 , the Shogunate was moved from Sanjo Bomon to Kitanokoji Muromachi . 
The Shogunate , after the move , was nicknamed " Hana no Gosho " ( Flower Palace ) , and also called the Muromachi Bakufu ( Shogunate ) after its new location . 
The administration and taxation authorities , which had been divided between the Court and the Shogunate , were integrated and a unit called Hokoshu or Bugyoshu was organized to handle practical matters , and was a standing army comparable to the Shugo Daimyo 's army in military strength . 
He also undertook the following actions to demonstrate his power : visit to Todai-ji Temple and Kofuku-ji Temple in 1385 , sight-seeing trip to Mt . Fuji in Suruga Province in 1388 , visit to Itsukushima Shrine in Aki Province in 1389 . 
In 1379 , Yoshimitsu 's residence was surrounded by the anti-Yoriyuki Shugo Daimyos such as Yoshiyuki ( Yoshimasa ) SHIBA and Yoriaki TOKI , who requested that he dismiss Yoriyuki , and consequently Yoriyuki was dismissed ( Koryaku Political Change ) . 
Yoshimasa succeeded to the post of Kanrei and personnel matters were taken over by the SHIBA clique . 
The Shogunate issued an order to hunt and kill Yoriyuki , but the following year pardoned him and after that he was included again in the administration with the post of shukuro , and during this period Yoshimitsu was able to establish his power as Shogun ; and based on these facts we can assume that he might have intended to make use of the rivalry between the two factions , SHIBA and HOSOKAWA , to get them to contain each other . 
After the death of Yoriyasu , he subdued the TOKI clan , taking advantage of the internal conflict while the TOKI were fighting on two sides . 
In 1391 , he intervened in the internal conflict of the YAMASHINAs and provoked Ujikiyo YAMANA , a powerful Shugo Daimyo dominating 11 provinces at that time who was called " Rokubun no ichi dono " ( Lord of one-sixth of the whole country ) to raise an army to subdue the YAMANAs . 
Yoshimitsu was again promoted and took the position of Naidaijin ( minister of internal affairs ) and Sadaijinn ( minister of the left ) , the higher official rankings that his grandfather and his father were not able to achieve . 
In 1383 he was the first samurai to become Genjichoja ( Head of the Genjis ) , and served concurrently as Betto ( supreme officer ) of the Junan-in and the Shogaku-in , and later he was granted a title " Jusango , " and reached the height of power of the samurai as well as the aristocrats . 
In 1392 , Yoshimitsu accelerated negotiations with the Southern Court with a help of Yoshihiro OUCHI as an intermediary , as the national influence of the Southern Court was declining . In the negotiations , he presented several following proposals for reconciliation : the emperor should be selected alternately from the two imperial lineages , Jimyoin-to and Daikakuji-to ; all the state-owned territories ( of which there was actually very little ) should belong to the Daikakuji-to ; the Three Sacred Treasures which were in the possession of Emperor Go-Kameyama should be presented to Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Jimyoin-to , so that the Southern Court would be dissolved . In this way , he achieved integration of the Northern and Southern Courts , and put a stop to the 58 year split between the courts . 
After Emperor Go-Enyu , who opposed Yoshimitsu and abdicated to Emperor Go-Komatsu , died in 1393 , Yoshimitsu established his power , and in 1394 , he handed over the post of Shogun to his son , Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA , and retired , but he continued to hold the real power . 
The same year , he finally rose to the post of Juichii Daijodaijin ( Chancellor of the Realm ) . 
The following year , he became a priest with a pseudonym , Dogi . 
It is thought that he became a priest in order to gain the ability to control temples and shrines , the remaining sphere he wanted to conquer after reaching the peak of the aristocratic spheres as Seii Taishogun , Taisei daijin and Junsangu . 
Following Yoshimitsu 's act , many samurai and aristocrats also became priests . 
In 1395 , Sadayo IMAGAWA , who held independent authority as Kyushu Tandai , was dismissed . 
In 1399 , he provoked a powerful Daimyo in the western region , Yoshihiro OUCHI , and using the excuse that Yoshihiro was taking up arms , he subdued Yoshihiro ( War of Oei ) , and in this way the influential factions that might oppose Yoshimitsu in the western region were eliminated . 
Yoshimitsu , since his younger days , had deeply admired Ming , wishing to establish trade between Japan and Ming . However , the government of Ming recognized Prince Kanenaga sole counterpart for negotiations , therefore , Yoshimitsu 's wish was not fulfilled . 
After the integration of the Northern and Southern Courts , he again intended to negotiate with Ming , under the nominal title of " Seii Shogun of Japan , Yoshimitsu MINAMOTO , " but the government of Ming would not accept an envoy dispatched by someone who presented himself as a vassal of the Emperor , because Ming traditionally did not trade with any retainer of a vassal . 
Then , Yoshimitsu became a priest , and then sent a merchant called Koitsumi from Hakata City and the priest Soa as missionaries to Ming in 1401 , with the aristocratic title of " Junsangu of Japan , Michiyoshi MINAMOTO , " instead of using the higher ( but samurai ) title of " Taisei Shogun . " 
Finally Emperor Jianwen of Ming offered a master-and-man relationship ( sakuho ) to the Japanese sovereign instead of to Prince Kanenaga , with whom Ming had wanted to have contact until then , and when Ming gave the Datongli calendar to Japan , the two countries ' diplomatic relations were formally established . 
In 1404 , he started Japan-Ming trade that took the form of tribute to the Ming emperor . He also was able to suppress Japanese pirates ( however , before the Ming 's government could dispatch an envoy to convey the emperor 's gratitude to the Japanese government , the Seinan War broke out in Ming , Emperor Jianwen abdicated , and Emperor Yongle took the throne ) . 
After the abolition of the embassies to China , in the Japanese aristocratic society , in which an isolation policy was practiced based on a petit Sino centrism , there were accumulated discontent with and criticism of the tribute trade because Japan was treated as vassal to the emperors of Ming ; but , as the aristocrats were not able to speak out publicly in the face of the Yoshimitsu 's strong influence , they could do nothing but comment on their dissatisfaction in diaries or other documents . 
Yoshimitsu , who adored Ming culture , pressed the Imperial Court to use the Chinese character 洪 in the name of Japanese eras after the Taizu of Ming , Emperor Hongwu ( 洪武帝 ) , but this was rejected by for various reasons , including the facts mentioned above . 
Yoshimitsu felt offended , and after that , he was never allowed to change the name of the era during his reign , and that is why the Oei was the longest era before Meiji . 
In 1397 , he received Hokusantei in Kitayama , Kyoto , from Kintsune SAIONJI , and constructed a mountain villa called Kitayamatei or Kitayamadono ( later Rokuon-ji Temple ) , placing a reliquary in the center . 
The culture of this period is called the Kitayama Culture , where the samurai style , aristocratic style and the Tang style ( Zen Buddhism style ) were merged . 
In 1408 , he died of a sudden illness in his 51st calendar year ( 49 years old ) . 
Buddhist name : Rokuonin Tenzan Dogi . 
After the death of Yoshimitsu , the title " Rokuonin Daijohoo ( Cloistered Emperor ) " was granted from the Imperial Court , but his son Yoshimochi , who became the fourth Shogun , declined the offer partly because Yoshiyuki ( Yoshimasa ) SHIBA and others opposed accepting the title ( on the other hand , his family temple , Shokoku-ji Temple seems to have accepted the title and therefore , Yoshimitsu 's name is registered as " Rokuonin Daijo Tenno " in the temple 's death register ) . 
It is said that during his life Yoshimitsu did not get along well with his son Yoshimochi , and the policies that Yoshimitsu introduced , such as the Imperial Court policy , control of the aristocracy and Shugo Daimyo , and foreign policy including trade with Ming , were denounced by Yshimochi . 
The Hokusantei , a heritage left by Yoshimitsu , was also destroyed by Yoshimochi , except for the Kinkaku . 
In his life , Yoshimitsu was extremely partial to Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA , his second son , and when Yoshitsugu absconded , Yoshimochi accused him of treason and killed him . 
Afterwards , the descendants of Yoshitsugu fled to Echizen , and they were called " Kuradanigosho . " 
Yoshimitsu 's son , Yoshinori ASHIKAGA , intended to continue Yoshimitsu 's policies when he became the 6th Shogun , but he was assassinated by Mitsusuke AKAMATSU during the Kakitsu War . 
Yoshimitsu 's grandson , Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA who became the 8th Shogun , also tried to follow his grandfather and father 's policies , but as he became disgusted with the Onin War and the puppet administration controlled by his vassals , he lost enthusiasm for political management . 
The Shugo Daimyos , who had served submissively during Yoshimitsu 's reign , began to take a defiant attitude toward the government again . 
Yoshinari TANAKA , Akira IMATANI , and others propose a theory that Yoshimitsu had an intention to usurp the imperial throne ; and based on this theory , some novelists including Chogoro KAIONJI and Motohiko IZAWA present their opinion that Yoshimitsu 's sudden death might confirm that he was assassinated to interrupt his plot . 
Yoshimitsu , from his younger days , was accustomed to using wither of two stylized signatures according to the situation , one for samurai affairs and the other for aristocratic affairs . He also made his second wife , Yasuko , become the Emperor Go-Komatsu 's junbo ( mother next to the Empress , treated as his mother ) , then made her a Nyoin ( wife of a former Emperor or princess who received the same treatment as Emperors ) . He also forced the nobles to offer their wives to him . 
He also usurped various authorities , such as those for rituals and for personnel affairs , from the Imperial Family . In April 1408 , one month before his death , he carried out the ceremony of Genpuku ( coming-of-age ceremony for boys ) for his second son , Yoshitsugu , on a scale comparable to ceremonies for an imperial prince . 
It is thought that all of this was done by Yoshimitsu with the intention of usurping the throne , and becoming Ming 's hosaku is also supposed to have been planned as a part of his plot , in order to make use of external pressure on the imperial court . 
Those who support the assassination theory suspect that Yoshimitsu was poisoned by the Imperial Court , who wanted to prevent his usurpation ( IZAWA deduces in his novel that the assassin was Zeami ) . 
There is another theory in which Yoshimochi 's side was worried about the future succession due to Yoshimitsu 's excessive partiality to Yoshitsugu . 
However , there were no descriptions in any documents of that period , such as nobles ' diaries , indicating suspicion that the actions taken by Yoshimitsu had been a part of his plot or that he was assassinated , and therefore , they can not offer any direct evidence either . 
By the way , usurpation here does not mean that Yoshimitsu himself wanted to take to the throne , but he wanted to take authority from the emperors by acquiring power as a sort of retired sovereign , and intended to hold real power even after his retirement . 
He tried to make his second son , Yoshitsugu , accede to the throne , while he himself , being his father , intended to be a retired sovereign . 
IMATANI supposes that Yoshimitsu was strongly influenced by China ( Ming ) , but he did not subscribe to idea that incumbent emperors could be overthrown by decree of heaven , instead making use of " Yamataishi , " a popular prophecy of the time . 
This verse is known as a prophecy , where it is predicted that the imperial reign would count 100 emperors , and according today 's study , the Emperor Go-Komatsu is considered to be the 100th emperor . 
However , because the reigns of the Kobun , Junnin , and Chukyo were not recognized at the time , and the Muromachi Shogunate naturally saw the Northern Court as legitimate , Emperor Go-Komatsu was considered to be the 99th . 
But , if the temporary unification of Emperor Go-Murakami in the Shohei unification during the Civil war of Kanno is counted , then Emperor Go-Komatsu is the 100th emperor . 
Thus , it could be interpreted to mean that Japan would be ruined after a monkey or dog had been called a hero . 
The idea that the imperial reign terminates with the 100th emperor is documented in Gukansho by Jien and other writings , and is supposed to have been widely accepted . 
Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA , the Kamakura Kubo , was born in the year of the monkey , according to the Chinese zodiac ( nowadays , he is considered to have been born in the year of boar ) , while Yoshimitsu was born in the year of dog ; therefore , there was an interpretation that the monkey and the dog represent these two people . 
On the other hand , IZAWA supposes that the author might have gotten the hint from The Tale of Genji .

Information 
Located in the Higashiyama Ward of Kyoto City , Sanjyo-Keihan Station is a stop on the Tozai Line , a Kyoto Municipal Subway Line . 
The station number is T11 . 
The Keihan Electric Railway 
Keihan Main Line and Keihan Oto Line in Sanjyo Station ( in Kyoto Prefecture ) 
An underground concourse outside its ticket gate connects Sanjyo-Keihan Station to Sanjyo Station . 
The platform is located on the fourth underground level , as are the platforms of other stations on the Tozai Line . Equipped with safety measures , the platform is what is known as an ' Island Platform , ' which is a single platform between double tracks ( one platform serving two tracks that run in opposite directions ) . 
Each station on the Tozai Line has its own color , and the color used at Sanjyo-Keihan Station is scarlet tinged with purple . 
Refer to Sanjyo-Keihan for details on the station 's surroundings , including the location of the bus station . 
Kyoto City Bus and other public transport firms have been calling this spot " Sanjyo-Keihan " since before the subway line was opened . 
The municipal subway chose to use the name Sanjyo-Keihan because Keihan was the name of another railway company and there was already a station named Sanjyo in Kyoto prefecture . 
The station opened on October 12 , 1997 , when the Tozai Line began operating between Daigo Station and Nijyo Station . 
On April 1 , 2007 , PiTaPa card was made available . 
The station facilities were built by Historical Corporation of Tozai Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway Lines , a third sector company . 
The Keihan Keishin Line uses the same tracks as the Tozai Line . They originally planned to share the tracks to this station because the Keihan Keishin Line ran between Misasagi Station and this station , which was above ground at the time . However , as they were unable to secure enough space around this area for a turnaround , the Keihan Keishin Line decided to extend the shared section to the next station , Kyoto Shiyakusyo-mae , when Sanjyo-Keihan Station was opened . ( They later extended the shared section even further to Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station when the Tozai Line was extended to that station in 2008 . )

One of the Goki-Shichido , referring to a region of Honshu along the Seto Inland Sea 
The region west of Kinai and along the Seto Inland Sea , from present-day West Hyogo Prefecture to Yamaguchi Prefecture , was collectively called Sanyodo . 
Harima-no-kuni 
Mimasaka-no-kuni - separated from Bizen-no-kuni in 713 . 
Bizen-no-kuni 
Bichu-no-kuni 
Bingo-no-kuni 
Aki-no-kuni 
Suo-no-kuni 
Nagato-no-kuni 
During the Ritsuryo period the Sanyodo connected Kinai ( Naniwa-kyo , Heijo-kyo , and Heian-kyo ) and North Kyushu ( Dazaifu and Hakata ) . 
The Sanyodo was only the first graded highway among the Shichido , and as such it was regarded as the most important because of the expected passage and stays of foreign missions . 
The eastern end of the road varied in response to the transfer of capitals such as Heijo-kyo and Heian-kyo . 
The ancient Sanyodo was approximately six to nine meters wide and generally straight in such a way that Kokufu and other areas throughout the region could be connected efficiently . 
The Sanyodo stretched northwest from Harima-no-kuni to Mimasaka-no-kuni , which was away from the main route . 
The Edo shogunate improved the Sanyodo as part of its road maintenance policy , which focused on five major highways . 
There were 42 yadoeki along the highway . 
During the Edo period , the Sanyodo ( otherwise known as Saigoku-kaido ) connected Kyoto to Shimonoseki City and further extended to Kokura City by crossing the Kammon-kaikyo Strait from Shimonoseki . 
This route was part of the truck line linking Edo and Nagasaki City . 
The Meiji government started its road management system by assigning numbers to national highways . 
During the Meiji period , the Sanyodo of the Edo period and earlier became a section of National Highway 3 connecting Tokyo City and Kobe City ( separating from National Highway 2 in Kyoto City ) ; and of National Highway 4 connecting Tokyo and Nagasaki City ; during the Taisho period it was integrated into National Highway 2 connecting Tokyo and Kagoshima City ( separating from National Highway 1 in Mie Prefecture ) . 
The Sanyodo has been passed down to National Highway 2 today , which connects Osaka City and Kita Kyushu City . 
Its route , however , differs from that of the Ritsuryo and Edo periods in many places . 
National Highway 2 from Okayama City ( Okayama Prefecture ) to Fukuyama City ( Hiroshima Prefecture ) takes a very different route ( Kamogata-orai Route ) . 
The Sanyo Jidoshado Expressway and the railway lines of the Sanyo Main Line and the Sanyo Shinkansen Line roughly follow the historical Sanyodo . 
The Sanyodo has served its function of connecting the Kinki region and Kyushu since the Ritsuryo period , and it continues in that manner today . 
When people say " Sanyodo " today , they are generally referring to the Sanyo Jidoshado Highway . 
The historical Sanyodo and the roads running in parallel with it are collectively called " Old Sanyodo " in Okayama Prefecture and East Hiroshima Prefecture , because National Highway 2 does not follow it between Okayama City ( Okayama Prefecture ) and Fukuyama City ( Hiroshima Prefecture ) . 
Kurama-dera Temple is a buddhist temple located in Kurama Honmachi , Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture . 
It used to belong to Tendai Sect , but since 1949 it became independent and is now the Head Temple of Kurama-kokyo Sect . 
Sango is Mount Kurama . 
It is said to have been established by Gantei , a leading disciple of Ganjin . 
In this temple , the Honzon ( main image of worship ) is referred to as " Sonten . " 
" Sonten " is said to be the Honzon that is a Trinity of Vaisravana , Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson . 
Is located at the north of Kyoto Basin , on the sourthern slope of Mount Kurama , where rich natural environment remains . 
Kurama is also famous as the place where Ushiwakamaru ( MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune ) trained himself , and it is also known as the setting for Jiro OSARAGI 's book , " Kurama Tengu . " 
It is the No. 19 New Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage Site . 
It operates a cable car ( Mount Kurama Cable Railway ) transportation to Kurama Temple , and it is the only religious corporation which operates a railway business . 
Various books including " Konjaku Monogatarishu " and " Fusoryakuki " describe the beginning of Kurama Temple , and it is said that a person named FUJIWARA no Isendo , who came from Fujiwara Nanke and served as the Head of Zoto-ji Temple , enshrined Vaisravana and sahasrabhuja , and built Kurama Temple . 
However , " Anbagaiji engi " , handed down for many generations in the temple , tells another story about the start of the temple , which is that Gantei , a high disciple of Ganjin , built a cottage in the 1st Year of Hoki , and enshrined Vaisravana . 
Gantei was the youngest among the eight high disciples who Ganjin brought back with him from Tang ( present day China ) . 
One night , in the third year of Hoki , Gantei saw a spiritual dream , which told him that there is a spiritual mountain in the north of Yamashiro Province . 
Gantei , who set off to visit the spiritual mountain , saw a white horse with a saddle made by treasures on top of a mountain . 
That was Mount Kurama . 
Gantei , on entering the mountain , was attacked and nearly killed by an ogre who took the form of a woman , but when he was in extreme danger , a dead tree fell down and crushed the ogre . 
The next morning , a statue of Vaisravana was there , and it is said that Gantei built a temple to worship this statue . 
This story about Gantei is only seen in " Anbagaiji engi " , and it is not clear how far it tells an actual historical event . 
Nevertheless , it is notable that a priest of South Capital ( Nara ) took part in establishing the temple , as in the case of the establishment of KiyomizuTemple . 
Later , in 796 , FUJIWARA no Isendo , who was in charge of building an official temple , To-ji Temple , wished to build a temple to place a Kannon that he personally worshiped . 
Isendo , in accordance with a message revealed to him in a spiritual dream one night , followed a white horse and arrived at Mount Kurama , upon which he saw a small shrine that housed Vaisravana . 
Isendo became suspicious saying , " I worship Kannon , but it is Vaisravana that is worshipped here . " 
However , in his dream that night , a child appeared and told him that " Kannon and Vaisravana have different names , but fundamentally they are one and the same . " 
Thus it is said that Isendo made a statue of sahasrabhuja and enshrined it together with Vaisravana . 
Kurama-dera Temple became a temple of Shingon Sect from around the time when Priest Buen of To-ji Temple entered Kurama Temple during Kanpyo era ( from 889 to 897 ) at the end of the 9th Century , but it changed to Tendai Sect in the 12th Century ; since then it has been under the control of Shoren-in for a long time . 
It appears to have attracted worshippers widely during the latter half of Heian period , as can seen by the fact that Emperor Shirakawa came to worship in 1091 and Moromichi FUJIWARA , the Kanpaku , in 1099 . 
" The Pillow Book " names the Front Approach of Ninety-nine Prayers of Kurama Temple as an example of " something which is near but also far " . 
Kurama Temple has been burned down many times , including by the fire of Year 1126 . 
In 1812 ( ninth year of Bunka of Edo period ) , there was a great fire that engulfed the whole mountain in flames , and more recently , the Main Shrine was burned down by a fire in Year 1945 . 
Therefore , all the buildings are new , but many cultural properties such as statues of the Buddha have been preserved . 
Koun SHIGARAKI , a chief priest in the Showa era , started Kurama-kokyo Sect in 1947 . 
In 1949 the temple became independent from Tendai Sect and is now the Head Temple of Kurama-kokyo Sect . 
In Mount Kurama , located in the mountains of Kyoto , mountain ascetic hermits actively practiced Vajrayana Buddhism . 
Therefore , it is said that Tengus , who are spirits of the mountains , live in Kurama . 
The highest-ranking Tengu that lives in Kurama is called Sojobo , and Mount Kurama is said to be one of the most supreme mountains for Tengu . 
Kurama-dera Temple , located north of Kyoto , was initially a temple with Vaisravana ( of the Four Heavenly Kings , the King protecting the north-side ) as its Honzon , and it also enshrined Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson . 
However , form of worship at the current Kurama Temple after the establishment of Kurama-kokyo is unique , and some explanation is necessary regarding its Honzon . 
According to the explanation by the temple after the establishment of Kurama-kokyo , the Honzon of Kurama Temple Main Shrine Golden Hall ( the Main Shrine ) is said to be " Sonten . " 
Within the shrine , Vaisravana is enshrined in the center , Saharabhuja is on the right side facing it , and Goho Maoson on the left side , and the three are collectively referred to as " Sonten . " 
" Sonten " is said to be " the cosmic energy that gives lfe and existence . " 
Moreover , Vaisravana represents the Spirit of Sunlight that symbolizes " Light " Saharabhujarepresents the Sprit of Moonlight that symbolizes " Love " , and Maoson represents the Spiritual King of Earth that symbolizes " Power . " 
The power of " Sonten " is believed to exist everywhere , and since this power is especially strong in this area Kurama-dera Temple is said to be a place of practice where one can be surrounded by such power . 
It is said that Goho Maoson , one of the Sonten , came to Earth from Venus 6.5 million years ago ( not " 650 years " ago ) ; its body is formed from elements different from those ordinary human beings , and it is said to be in an eternal existence at the age of 16 and it does not age . 
Vaisravana , Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson that are enshrined in Golden Hall of the Main Shrine are all secret Buddha statues [ not open for public viewing ] ; in their stead statues referred to as " Omae-dachi " are enshrined in front of these secret Buddha Statues . 
Omae-dachi Maoson statue looks like an unworldly person , with wings on its back , and a long beard , and has a high nose . 
The aureola is made from tree leaves . 
Goho Maoson enshrined in Two-storied pagoda has a similar form . 
Therefore , it is believed that " Kurama Tengu " was initially Goho Maoson . 
Although it is said to be 16 years old , it looks aged . 
Nio-mon was burned down in 1891 , and rebuilt in 1911 . 
The cable car from Sanmon Station to Tahoto Station started operating in 1957 . 
Tahoto was rebuilt in 1959 . 
Great Hall was rebuilt in Year 1971 . 
Shinden was built in 1924 . 
Tenhorindo Hall was rebuilt in 1969 . 
Mao-den of penetralia is a small shrine on top of a oddly-shaped rock located on a mountain road on the way from the Main Shrine to Kibune Shrine in the West . 
It enshrines Maoson , which is said to have arrived on Earth from Venus 6.5 million years ago . 
The current building was rebuilt after being burnt down in 1945 . 
Reihoden Hall is located at the back of the Main Shrine . 
On the 1st Floor there is Kuramayama Museum , which has an exhibition of the animals and plants of Mount Kurama . 
The 2nd Floor houses Temple Treasure Exhibit Room and Yosano Memorial Hall , which exhibits articles , and other items left by Tekkan YOSANO and Akiko YOSANO ( Koun SHIGARAKI , who started Kurama-kokyo Sect , was a poet who studied under the YOSANO 's ) . 
On the 3rd Floor there is a sanctuary of Buddhist statues , which exhibits cultural properties including three standing statues : Wooden statue of Bishamonten , Wooden statue of Kosshouten , and Wooden statue of Zennishi-doji . 
There is a view that the Honzon of Kurama-dera Temple were these three statues of Bishamonten , and there is another view that the Honzon probably looked similar to the Tobatsu-Bishamonten of the latter half of Heian era , which is an Important Cultural Property ; this statue is also enshrined in Reihoden Hall . 
Articles excavated from the Ruin of Kyozuka , which are items born from the idea of the Latter Day of the Law during the latter half of the Heian period can also be seen here . 
Also , Akiko YOSANO 's library , named " Tohaku-tei " , has been moved from its original location and reconstructed in front of Reihoden Hall .

From Demachiyanagi Station of Eizan Electric Railway , Kurama Line , it takes approximately 30 minutes to arrive at Kurama Station . 
It takes 1 minute by foot to go from the station to Nio-mon ( Main Gate ) . 
From Nio-mon to Main Shrine Golden Hall ( on foot ) . 
Nio-mon ( 0 ) - 287m - Yuki Shrine ( 50 ) - 791m - Main Shrine Golden Hall ( 160 ) 
The numbers in brackets are altitude measurements based on that of Nio-mon ( unit : m ) .

Because it is hard to visit and worship on foot for the elderly people , cable car ( Mount Kurama Cable Railway ) is operates between Nio-mon and Two-storied Pagoda . 
The time spent in the cable car is only about 2 minutes , and those who contribute 100 yen to the temple can ride the cable car for free ( essentially , the fare is 100 yen one way ) . 
From the Two-storied Pagoda to Main Shrine Golden Hall , you need to walk about 10 minutes on a stone paved road . 
If you are visiting and worshipping on foot , you need to go via Yuki Shrine . 
The temple encourages people who can walk the distance , not to use the cable car and visit and worship the temple on foot .

In Summer , 2007 , Grandelfino took part in Student Formula SAE Competition of JAPAN . 
And its car managed to run till the end of the Endurance Check Category of the Competition , in which 28 teams did the same . 
It ranked the 52nd out of 61 teams . 
The team 's name Grandelfino is a coinage made of the words " Delfino " , an Italian word for dolphin , and " Grand " , meaning great or magnificent . 
Note : For now , many KIT students do n't know about the actual conditions of this project . 
Matsugasaki Festival 
It 's held over three days from the third Friday until Sunday every November . 
KIT is off not only on those three days but on the day before and after the festival for its preparation and cleanup .

Myo ( 妙 ) and Ho ( 法 ) , known as " Gozan no Okuribi " , can be seen nearby from the campus . 
Honchi-suijaku is one of the thoughts of Shinbutsu-shugo ( the amalgamation of Buddhism with Shinto ) that emerged during the era in which Buddhism flourished in Japan ; it supports the view that yao yorozu no kami ( eight million gods ) are Gongens , the embodiment of various types of Buddhas ( including Bosatsu ( Bodhisattva ) and Tenbu ( Deva ) ) , which appeared in the land that was Japan . 
Summary 
Honchi indicates the state of enlightenment , while Suijaku , which literally means " bringing down jaku ( Ato ) , " indicates the appearance of Shinto and Buddhist deities . 
The ultimate Honchi is considered to be Hossin ( the truth of the universe ) and is therefore called Honchi-hossin . 
As the " gon " of Gongen means " provisional " or " temporary , " as shown in " Gon-dainagon ( an acting chief councilor of state ) , Gongen indicates a Buddha that has tentatively appeared in the form of a god . 
The concept of Honchi originated from the inclusive nature of Buddhism , which encompassed a wide range of indigenous religions as it spread throughout the region . 
This is evidenced by the fact that most Buddhist Tenbu ( Deva ) gods originate from Hindu , India 's indigenous religion . 
The thought also gave rise to a theory of esoteric Buddhism ( of the later Mahayana Buddhism ) that Kajishin like Fudo myo-o ( Acala ) is the embodiment of Dainichi nyorai ( Vairocana ) . 
On the other hand , the concept of Suijaku came from a Chinese character , 迹 ( jaku ) , which first appeared in the Tenun chapter of " Soshi ( Zhuang-zi ) " or in its phrase of ' 所以迹 ' ( the path of edification ) , and was later referred to by Guo Xiang of West Jin , the writer of " Zhuang-zi Commentary " who developed his own theory in the chapter of " Seong-wang ( Daiseigaio ) " and defined jaku as a royal reign , citing " 所以迹 " as a born saint . 
It was Seng-zhao , of the late Qin , who first brought the concept to Buddhism . 
Seng-zhao cited , in his writing " Chuyuimakitsukyo ( Vimalak ? rti Sutra commentary ) , " the idea of " Honmatsu , " which had been referred to by Wang Bi of Wei , and other scholars replaced the word " 所以迹 " with " 本 " ( hon ) and defined it ( hon ) as an unfathomable nirvana ( enlightenment ) achieved by Bodhisattva and " 迹 " ( jaku ) as a means to enlighten people , as used by Bodhisattva . 
His theory , as endorsed by Hokekyo ( Lotus Sutra ) , which supports Kuon jitsujo--a view that Buddha had been in nirvana long before he was born into this world--further influenced Zhiyi of the Chinese Tendai Sect , thus providing a basis for the development of Hokekyo 's educational interpretations and the division of its scripture into " Jaku-mon " ( the first half ) and " Hon-mon " ( the second half ) . 
This created a widely accepted view that Hon is the Buddha or enlightenment itself while Jaku is simply a means by which to save and enlighten people . 
In Japan , as is evident in the confrontation between the Mononobe clan and the Soga clan during the Nara era , there has been a dividing line between Shinto and Buddhism since it was officially introduced to Japan . 
However , the line was gradually eroded as the Buddhists took the view that Shinto gods are a kind of lost , poor people , like the Tenbu ( Deva ) gods . 
They tried to raise their status to that of the Buddha by leaving copies of sutras at temples or doing Doso , officially acknowledging the gods ' achievements and stating in oracles that they would no longer stay as a god thanks to Buddha 's good deeds . 
In the Tenmu period of the late seventh century , when the Emperor-centered political regime was put in place , the Shinto gods that had played important roles in building the country--including Amaterasu Omikami , the highest ranking Ujigami ( local god ) of all--were elevated in status to ethnic gods , and this encouraged Buddhists to give them higher ranking as a token of respect . 
Because these gods were considered to be members of the Goho zenjin , a group of gods who respected and guarded the Buddhist law , some were even granted Bosatsu-go ( the title of Bodhisattva ) from the end of the Nara era through the Heian era . 
A typical example of this is Hachimanshin , a famous ethnic god also known as Hachiman Daibosatsu . 
However , some low-profile minor ethnic gods , like the spirits of nature and death , to whom the Honchi-suijaku theory was not applied , were treated differently . 
They are , for example , Jitsurui no kami ( Jitsurui gods ) or Jissha no kami ( Jissha gods ) , as opposed to Gonsha no kami . 
To make their position clear , some Buddhists codified a warning that permitted people to respect Gongeshin but not Jitsurui no kami . 
This must have been an intentional effort to keep Buddhism separate from Shinto . 
The theory of Honji-suijaku affected art and architecture , giving birth to Honchi-suijaku zuga ( pictures ) and Gongen-zukuri ( buildings ) , and during the middle and end of the Kamakura era it affected literature as well , resulting in a series of works called Honchimono . 
By the middle of the Kamakura era there appeared a group of people who insisted in the Shinpon butsujaku theory that Buddhas were in turn the embodiment of Shinto gods and that Shinto gods were the masters that Buddhas followed . 
This theory was originated by Shinto people who had complained about Buddhism , which had been dominant over Shinto , and wanted Shinto to achieve independent status from it . 
The Watarai clan , who had served as priests of Gegu ( the outer shrine of Ise jingo ) organized and re-edited myths and the records of Shinto ceremonies in order to compile the Shinto Gobusho ( five-volume apologia of Shinto ) ; their work laid the foundation for Ise Watarai Shinto . 
Additionally , an attempt was made to theorize Shinto by borrowing the doctrine of the Tendai sect , which had adopted the reality-affirming Hongaku philosophy , and to re-edit several kinds of theory books by falsely attributing them to Kukai ; but later these works were organized by Yukitada and Ieyuki WATARAI . 
From the period of the Northern and Southern Courts through the Muromachi era , the anti-Honchi-suijaku theory increasingly gained ground to the point where some monks of the Tendai sect supported it . 
Jihen , the author of " Kujihongi Gengi " and " Toyowashihara Shinpuwaki , " converted to Shinto ; and Ryohen of the Tendai sect , the author of " Jindai no maki shikenbun " and " Tenchi reiki kibunsho , " supported his theory . 
Following these moves , Kanetomo YOSHIDA wrote the book titled " Yuiitsu shinto myoho yoshu ( The Only Shinto Scripture ) , " making Jihen 's theory more complete and comprehensive . 
However , new Buddhist schools that emerged during the Kamakura era supported the Honchi-suijaku theory as they were supposed to do . 
Note that the anti-Honchi-suijaku theory was given its name by the scholars of the Showa era . 
Suijakushin ( the god of suijaku ) and Honchibutu ( the Buddha of honchi ) 
The Buddha , the identity of the gods , is called Honchibutsu . 
Buddhas that are forcibly linked to Shinto gods are different from religion to religion , faith to faith , temple to temple and shrine to shrine . 
Although the most popular Buddhist title granted to Japanese gods is Bosatsu ( Bodhisattva ) , some of them--like Hachiman Daibosatsu , whose Honchibutsu title is Amida nyorai ( Amitabha ) --carry a Honchibutsu title that differs from the corresponding Buddhist title . 
The following shows some of the relationships between Suijakushin and Honchibutsu : 
Amaterasu = Dainichi nyorai ( Vairocana ) + Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu 
Hachimanshin = Amida nyorai ( Amitabha ) = Emperor Ojin 
Kumano Gongen = Amida nyorai ( Amitabha ) 
Oyama kui no kami = Amaterasu omikami = Dainichi nyorai ( Vairocana ) 
Ichikishima-hime = Benzaiten ( Sarasvati ) 
Atagoo Gongen = Akiba Gongen = Jizo Bosatsu ( Jizo Bodhisattva ) 
Susanoo = Gozu Tenno 
Okuninushi = Daikokuten ( Mahakala ) 
Tosho Daigongen ( Ieyasu TOKUGAWA ) = Yakushi nyorai ( Bhaisaya ) 
Matsuo Taisha Shrine = Yakushi nyorai ( Bhaisaya ) 
Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) was one of the Shogun positions in Japan 's Ryoge no kan ( class outside of the Ritsuryo system ) . 
It was abolished in the Meiji Restoration . 
It was one of the names given to the general dispatched to the eastern part of the country from the Nara period to the Heian period . 
Also abbreviated to Shogun , Kubo , Taiju , Taijuko , Gosho , etc . 
Although there were no posts called Seiju Taishogun or Seiban Taishogun , there were the similar posts of Seiteki Daishogun and Seisei Taishogun . 
From the Kamakura period until the Edo period , it was the head of the Shogunate , a position held by the leader of the samurai families , and became hereditary to his descendants . 
Although he was formally a retainer appointed by imperial edict , he was in fact the ruler of Japan who even held sway over the Imperial Court , and typically was treated as the king by outsiders . 
' Seii ' means ' to conquer the barbarians . ' 
The Seii Taishogun was a general appointed for conquering ' barbarians , ' and led an army in an advance from the Pacific Ocean side . 
A general who led an army 's advance to the Japan Sea side was called Seiteki Daishogun , and one who led an army 's advance into Kyushu was called Seisei Taishogun . 
It is thought that this was an adaptation of the Sinocentrism of ' Shii ' ( four barbarians ) , ' toi , seiju , namban and hokuteki . ' 
In fact , at first it was called ' Seii ' but from Hoki onward it became ' Seito , ' and was again called ' Seii ' from 793 on . 
The first ' Seii Shogun ' was appointed on September 29 , 720 , and was Tajihi Agatamori ; the first ' Seito Taishogun ' was appointed on December 7 , 788 , and was KI no Kosami . 
The title of Shogun is not uniform in the records , with FUJIWARA no Umakai , for example , being ' Jisetsu Taishogun ' at the time of his appointment , and ' Seii Jisetsu Taishi ' at the time of his return to the Capital . 
On July 13 , 791 , OTOMO no Otomaro was appointed Seito Taishi . 
On February 17 , 793 , Seitoshi was changed to Seiishi . 
' Shi ' was also called ' Shogun , ' and one school of thought says this is the first appearance of a Seii Taishogun , but the issue gets more complicated . 
Below OTOMO no Otomaro was the Seito Fukushi / Seii Fukushi , SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro , who was appointed Seii Taishogun on November 5 , 797 . 
Tamuramaro brought Aterui , of the Ezo of Isawa , who had fought stubbornly until then , back to the capital , thereby conquering that land . 
Practically speaking , Tamuramaro can be seen as the first Seii Taishogun . 
Later , on April 17 of 811 , during a battle with the Ezo , FUNYA no Watamaro was appointed Seii Shogun , without the ' tai , ' and on December 11 of that year reported the end of the conquest of the Ezo , and MONONOBE no Taritsugu , who had been Fukushogun , rose to Chinju Shogun ( without the ' fu ' ) , but on November 17 , 814 , became again Seii Shogun without the ' tai . ' 
In fact , below the Seii Taishogun were the posts of Seii Fukushogun , Seii Gungen , Seii Gunso , etc . 
At first MINAMOTO no Yoritomo was nothing but the leader of the Kanto Bushidan ( Kamakura-dono ) , and did not hold a position under the Ritsuryo system . 
That is to say that at first he was only the head of a provincial insurrection , the same as TAIRA no Masakado . 
That same Yoritomo 's plan for a new government used as models the three governments of the Taira family , KISO Yoshinaka , and the provincial government of the Oshu Fujiwara clan , and it is thought that the form of the Kamakura government was molded out of comparative consideration of these . 
Under the administration led by the Taira family , given that the position of court noble was already very high at the time , court nobles reached the height of their powers when the Taira family , part of the Taira clan , became court nobles . 
In contrast to that , Yoritomo worked toward elevating the status of warriors themselves . 
With respect to the Imperial Court , they sought a suitable position in order to establish the independent sovereignty of the warriors . 
Yoshinaka KISO , who advanced into the central area and Kyoto , took the position called ' Seii Taishogun , ' which had previously existed . 
The position of Seii Taishogun had a hint of a mission to punish the eastern forces , and Yoshinaka 's hidden intent to oppose Yoritomo has been surmised from that , but the Yoshinaka government was over very shortly ( in fact , in recent years the story that says Yoshinaka was not ' Seii Taishogun ' but ' Seito Taishogun ' is gaining ground . 
It is the later compilations such as " Azuma Kagami " and " Hyakurensho " that give him the title ' Seii Taishogun , ' while " Gyokuyo " and " Sankaikoryonukigakiyo " ( excerpts from " Sankaiki " ) , historical documents that were written at the time these events took place , have his title as ' Seito Taishogun . ' 
Furthermore , it is thought that , as a post that would conquer Yoritomo of Bando , ' Seito Taishogun , ' a post previously taken by FUJIWARA no Tadabumi to conquer TAIRA no Masakado of Bando , was better than ' Seii Taishogun , ' which conquered the Ezo of Ou . 
The Oshu Fujiwara clan ruled the northeast region at that time , as it was an area to which the Imperial Court 's rule did not extend . 
The Oshu Fujiwara clan secured the position of ' Chinjufu Shogun ' and called their own residence ' Yanagi no Gosho ' or ' Ryuei . ' 
Ryuei is another name for the Shogunate . 
The Chinjufu Shogun was granted regional autonomy in the form of military rule within Mutsu Province and Dewa Province , and as this position was formally one of an officer commanding the standing army on the border ( in the case of the Seii Taishogun , it was commanding a temporary expeditionary force ) , it was not necessary for the holder of this title to live in Kyoto , which was very convenient for a regional leader . 
This seems to have been the Yoritomo government in microcosm . 
In 1190 Yoritomo was appointed to Ukone no Daisho ( Udaisho ) and had his own organs of household government approved as government offices . 
However , the Konoe Daisho was required , by the nature of that position , to live in Kyoto , and was not suited to moving toward independence in Kanto . 
Then Yoritomo resigned from Udaisho , and held onto those privileges as a former Udaisho . 
It is thought that the notion of using the title of ' former Udaisho ' for heads of state in the Kamakura government was not unheard of . 
However , although the formal position of the post of Udaisho was high , compared to the rival KISO Yoshinaka , who was Seii Taishogun ( or Seito Taishogun ) , as it was an officer of the central imperial guards , it was not a position for actively suppressing regional disturbances with military force . 
Also , compared to the Oshu Fujiwara clan 's Chinjufu Shogun , it lacked the important , active element of ' warrior 's self-rule . ' 
What Yoritomo turned his attention to then was the office of ' Seii Taishogun . ' 
As military rule ( regional sovereignty ) , it was the same as the Chinjufu Shogun . 
However , given that the goal of this position was to lead the Bando soldiers ( in this case , warriors from eastern Japan ) to victory over the Ezo of Ou ( in this case , the Oshu Fujiwara clan ) , it was traditionally a post superior to that of Chinjufu Shogun . 
To put it another way , the Seii Taishogun was the one who placed a private position called Kamakura-dono to rule as a leader of the warriors of eastern Japan , Shugo and Jito throughout the country , was recognized as Udaisho with the authority to exercise military police powers , had family organs of clan governance treated the same as official government offices , and bundled it all together and officially secured it . 
However , there is reason to believe that the post of Seii Taishogun was deemed necessary especially in the Oshu War to defeat the Oshu Fujiwara clan , and when he was in fact appointed in 1192 it had already lost its importance to Yoritomo . 
Yoritomo was not in fact very attached to the Seii Taishogun post , and indicated his intent to resign 2 years later in 1194 . 
Also , MINAMOTO no Yoriie was his heir and right away was appointed to Sakone no Chujo , and then Saemon no Kami , and was proclaimed Seii Taishogun 3 years later . 
Then at the time of the HIKI Yoshikazu Incident , the succession of the positions of Sotsuibushi and Sojito were in question , and the Shogun posts were not involved . 
Consequently , at this stage the Shogun post was not an absolute requirement for leadership of the warrior families , and may not have been seen as that important . 
On the other hand , the post of Shogun was proclaimed first when it came to succeeding MINAMOTO no Sanetomo . 
When the Minamoto clan 's Shoguns ended after the third one , Shoguns from regent families or royal Shoguns were installed as puppets and the regent Hojo clan held the real power . 
From the Kamakura period on , after MINAMOTO no Yoritomo took the position of Seii Taishogun and started the Shogunate , the warrior families came to control Japanese politics . 
Along with that Seii Taishogun was the highest authority of the warrior families and Japan 's substantive sovereign . 
Although it was originally a post bestowed by the Imperial Court , actual appointments , except for a time during the New Kemmu Government , were at the request of the person whose influence placed him at the pinnacle of samurai society . 
Formally speaking , among the nobles it was recognized that the Court was the true government and the Shogunate was a temporary government in the provinces . 
However , among warrior families that was not the case . 
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Akiie KITABATAKE of the Southern Court , as Chinjufu Shogun , was allowed to be called Chinjufu Taishogun , but it is thought that this was done to put it on a level with and oppose the Seii Taishogun . 
Historical Traditions 
It was customarily accepted by the warrior families that ' the families that could rise to Shogun , leader of the samurai , were limited to those extending from the Seiwa Genji . ' 
Because the Oda family claimed a connection with the Taira family , Nobunaga ODA was not able to become ' Seii Taishogun ' ; and when Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was appointed ' Seii Taishogun , ' he falsified a connection to the Seiwa Minamoto clan ; and there are other such tales . 
However , Nobunaga ODA in fact received an imperial recommendation for ' appointment to Seii Taishogun , ' so realistically there was no basis for the idea that one could not be Shogun if he was not from the Minamoto clan ( it seems that the reason Ieyasu claimed Minamoto heritage was not only to become Shogun , but that by becoming the Minamoto clan chief and entering the post of Shogun , he would oppose Hideyoshi 's warrior Kampaku system and aimed to gain authority to rule over both the warriors and the nobles ) . 
Furthermore , even after Yoritomo , there are examples of regent Shogun and imperial Shogun , so it was not in fact limited to the Seiwa Minamoto clan . 
All this can be interpreted to mean that someone from the Minamoto or Taira clans , or even from the noble Fujiwara clan , could become Seii Taishogun . 
A recently popular explanation on the subject is that , since ' Seii Taishogun ' was originally a post for leading soldiers of eastern Japan in conquest over the Ezo , the condition for assuming office was that he had to be ' someone who controls eastern Japan in some form . ' 
There are various opinions as to whether or not Nobunaga ODA wanted to be Seii Taishogun , but it is not possible to know for sure . 
In fact , there is some speculation that what became a nominal qualification for the imperial recommendation for appointment to Seii Taishogun was that Nobunaga wiped out the Takeda clan , who were eastern Japan Daimyo , and effectively made the Hojo clan of Kanto subservient . 
Also , there are those who say that Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI was not able to become Seii Taishogun because he lost to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in the battles of Komaki and Nagakute . 
However , Hideyoshi was appointed to Kampaku , a higher ranking position than Seii Taishogun . 
For that reason , it is possible to speculate that Hideyoshi was not interested in the Shogun post , and wanted not a simple samurai government , but a new government that would subsumed the nobles . 
On the other hand , there was previously , among the nobles , a tendency to view a person 's pedigree - whether Minamoto or Taira clan - as ' Taira who are close to the nobles ' or ' the warrior Minamoto clan who are difficult to control . ' 
Also stemming from this came the idea that the Minamoto and Taira clans , or the Minamoto and Taira families , alternately take control of political power in Japan ( Gempei kotai shiso ) . 
In fact , although there is an apocryphal tale that TAIRA no Tomomori and Mitsuhide AKECHI were appointed to Seii Taishogun , there is no historical evidence to indicate so .
