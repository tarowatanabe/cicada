Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the Chinese five Houses / seven Schools of Zen ( Rinzai , Igyou , Soto , Unmon , Hogan ) and Gigen RINZAI ( ? - 867 ) of Tang was its founder . 
He was known as " RINZAI of Katu ( meaning to help wake up the sleeping mind ) " and " General RINZAI " , and rose to the top of Chinese Zen with his distinctive style . 
With its Zen Talks that try to awaken self awareness through study of Koan , it differs from the Silent Zen of the Soto sect , which just does meditation . 
Rinzai School in China 
As the name implies , Rinzai School started with its founder Gigen RINZAI at the end of the Tang dynasty , after the anti-Buddhist movement at the Kaishou era . 
RINZAI was the disciple of Kiun OBAKU ; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of Hebei , with the support of Changshi WANG of the Hanchin government , but in the confusion that arose around the end of the Tang dynasty , Hebei was at the center of the tumultuous five dynasties and it became difficult to sustain a religious movement . 
The central figure around that time was Enshou FUKETSU . 
It was in the Northern Song dynasty that Rinzai School became vibrant again , below the gates of Sekiso SOEN , along with Enan OURYU and Houe YOUGI who came from Jiangxi province and created the two main sectes of Rinzai ( Ouryu and Yougi ) , and swept across all of China . 
When it came to the Southern Song dynasty , Soukou DAIE , a disciple of Kokugon ENGO who belonged to the Yougi sect , started the Daikan sect in Zhejiang province , which became a major sect in the Rinzai School . 
Rinzai School in Japan 
According to doctrine , it was brought over to China from India by Bodhidharma , the 28th successor of the 10 disciples ( called Kasho ) who directly received the teaching ( enlightenment ) of Siddhartha Gautama . 
Later the Rinzai school , which achieved the pinnacle of Zen teaching , was brought to Japan in the Kamakura period by Eisai , who went to China to study in the Southern Song period . 
Japan 's Rinzai is one of Zen schools in Japan . 
It emphasizes the transmission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple . ( Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master . ) 
It calls Sakyamuni the Original Teacher Venerable Sakyamuni Buddha , Bodhidharma the First Ancestor and Great Teacher Bodhidharma , and RINZAI the Founder and Great Teacher Rinzai . 
In contrast to the Soto Zen school which spreads through regional clans and the general people , the Rinzai School received support from Samurai families in government , and was esteemed in the politics and culture . 
Later , the Rinzai School was rebuilt in the Edo period by Master HAKUIN , and continued to be called Hakuin Zen . 
Traditions 
Transmission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day ( Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master ) . 
The important interaction between the master and disciple is called " a secret in the room " and is not to be taken out of the master 's room and revealed publicly . 
What is extracted from the interactions between a master and disciple , or Zen lecture transcripts that record the actions of a master , is called a Koan ( precedent ) and various collections have been compiled since the Song dynasty ; but enlightenment is not something that can be communicated with words , so when people today try to understand the text , the Koan itself refuses them . 
However , they contain hints that lead people toward enlightenment , and there are a great many Zen books from the beginning down to the present day . 
Also since the Song dynasty , the Zen schools changed to a Kannazen style in which masters give lectures using transcripts of Zen talks and the masters became not to display the same majesty as those in the Tang dynasty including Rinzai . 
Although masters choose their successors when they die , the successors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time , but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself . 
Even if the new master had not attained enlightenment , the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment , therefore it is possible to take such a measure . 
It is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters , or at his discretion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end . 
Many lines have split , and some have disappeared ; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day . 
Enlightenment 
The Zen sects generally emphasize enlightenment over knowledge . 
Enlightenment in Zen means that all living things realize the inherent buddha nature they possess . 
For this reason , masters in the Tang dynasty struggled to enlightenment through much hardship . 
However , they began to devise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the Song dynasty . 
These were systematized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as Zazen ( not the same as meditation ) , Koan ( understanding stories that surpass intellectual understanding ) , Dokyou ( reading sutras ) , or Samu ( everyday work ) under an already enlightened Zen master . 
Enlightenment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a candle flame passes to a candle that is unlit ( called Dentou ) . 
That is not a transmission based on words ( logos ) . 
For this reason , it is considered crucial to choose the right Zen master . 
That means not just choosing one who has gained enlightenment , but one who fits with one 's own personality . 
Actually , it does not mean that an enlightened Zen master instructs and enables someone gain enlightenment . 
Masters in the Tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from anybody - not to mention Siddhartha Gautama ( Buddha , Shakuson ) , who gained enlightenment without a teacher . 
While it is impossible to define enlightenment with words , words are one of many methods that can describe the boundaries of enlightenment . 
That is why , especially after it was brought to Japan , enlightenment has been expressed through artistic expression such as poetry and painting , so that one can get a taste of its aroma . 
Other than in art , it is also expressed in deportments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement ; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born . 
That is not an intellectual understanding . 
The Koan System 
The Koan system came together after the Song dynasty , and though they might be fabricated it has made even more enlightenments possible . 
Most Koan are made up of conversations between a master and disciple , telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment . 
Koan can not be received with logical , intellectual understanding , and are stories beyond logic that can be understood only by completely becoming the Koan itself instead of thinking . 
The Koan system was established by collecting these Koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 Koan stories . 
Koan system differs according to the master 's style . 
Examples of Koan stories in the beginning . 
" Does a dog have buddha-nature ? " " It does not have . " 
As the background , any Buddhist knows that " all living things have Buddha-nature . " 
The Sound of One Hand Clapping 
A disciple has to listen to the sound of clapping with one hand and show that to the master . 
By intellectual understanding , it is impossible to clap with one hand and make a sound .

Fushimi-jo Castle was a castle in what is now Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City . 
" Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle " is a recent construction that did not exist historically ( details to follow ) . 
Fushimi-jo Castle was originally built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI for his own residence after retirement . 
Construction spanning the reigns of 3 emperors , it was first built on Mt . Shizuki , there called Shizuki Fushimi-jo Castle , and after an earthquake was moved to Mt . Kohata and named Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle . 
Furthermore , there was the Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle that was built in the days of Toyotomi , and the one that was rebuilt in the Tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of Sekigahara . 
After Hideyoshi 's death and in accordance with his will , Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to Osaka-jo Castle ; after which Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , leader of the council of 5 elders , moved into this castle and took over government . 
Although it was protected by Ieyasu 's vassals , Mototada TORII et alia , during the Battle of Sekigahara , it was attacked and burned by Ishida ( the Siege of Fushimi-jo Castle ) . 
It was later rebuilt by Ieyasu ; and after it was razed its structures and materials were moved to other locations . 
After it was razed , the location of the citadel was made into a peach orchard and was called Momoyama ( Peach Mountain ) . 
That is why Fushimi-jo Castle is typically called Momoyama-jo Castle ; and this is the reason why the period of Oda-Toyotomi government is called the " Azuchi-Momoyama Period " and the culture of the time called " Momoyama Culture " . 
According to the account that says the descendants of the family that reclaimed the land are the Yoshimura family , which founded Yoshimura Shuzo , they were the heads of Horiuchi Village , built on the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle ; and it is said that they transferred village land to the Imperial Household in the Meiji Period . 
Historically , there was no direct connection . 
Since the Tokugawa-era keep was moved to Nijo-jo Castle , there is a relatively large number of artifacts left ; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep . 
The details are unclear . 
1592 - In the low-lying hills along the Uji-gawa River where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI made his home on Mt . Shizuki in retirement , parts of the dismantled Jurakudai were transferred for the building of a castle ( Shizuki-jo Castle ) . 
1596 - Because it was destroyed in an earthquake , a new castle was built about 500 meters away on Mt . Kohata ( present day Mt . Momoyama ) . 
1598 - Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle 
1600 - Burned in the Siege of Fushimi Castle 
1601 - Rebuilt by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA 
1603 - Was the site of the inauguration of Seii Taishogun 
Fushimi-jo Castle 's functions moved to Osaka-jo Castle after the Siege of Osaka , reducing this castle 's importance in the eyes of the Edo Shogunate ; and it was therefore razed in 1625 after Ieyasu TOKUGAWA 's retirement . 
1964 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land , an amusement park featuring a mock castle keep " Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle " , was built on the site of the Fushimi-jo Castle flower garden . 
January 2003 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land was closed as part of the restructuring of its parent company , Kintetsu Corporation . 
Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle escaped destruction thanks to a movement by the people of Kyoto to preserve it as a symbol of Fushimi . 
Nowadays it is maintained as a park . 
The City of Kyoto received it at no cost ; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deteriorated with age . 
October 2007 - When it was remodeled to look like Osaka-jo Castle for the filming of a period movie , " Chacha : The Woman from Far Away " , the tiger decorations below the watch tower and Shachihoko were painted gold . 
With Toei Films bearing the remodeling cost of around 1 million yen , work to remake it into Osaka-jo Castle continues within the year . 
When the castle was dismantled , the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations . 
The most famous are Nijo-jo Castle and Jojakko-ji Temple ; the turrets , castle gate , palace , bath , Tamon Yagura Turret , and earthen walls all were moved to Fukuyama-jo Castle ( Bingo Province ) . 
Below is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist . 
Note : Among these , the only ones that can be proven are the guest hall of Saikyo-ji Temple , which is the remains from Mt . Shizuki , and Fukuyama-jo Castle 's Fushimi Yagura , which is left over from the Tokugawa era .

The Kanoha group is the largest gaha ( group of painters ) in Japanese art history , and was active for about 400 years from the middle of the Muromachi period ( fifteenth century ) to the end of the Edo period ( nineteenth century ) as a group of expert painters that consistently dominated the art world . 
Masanobu KANO , the official painter of the Muromachi shogunate , was the earliest ancestor ; his descendants worked for Nobunaga ODA , Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and the Tokugawa Shogun as painters after the collapse of the Muromachi shogunate , consistently dominating the art world associated with the powers-that-be , thus greatly influencing Japanese art circles as a professional painter group working on works ranging from screen paintings in the Imperial Palace , castles or large temples to small paintings such as those created on fans . 
The Kanoha group is a painter group mainly concerned with consanguinity such as parents or brothers ; it reigned over the nation 's realm of art for as long as four centuries , a period unequaled anywhere in the world . 
Prominent painters of the Kanoha group include the founder Masanobu KANO , who worked for Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Muromachi shogunate ; his heir , Motonobu KANO , a grandson of Motonobu ; Eitoku KANO , who created screen paintings of the Azuchi and Osaka castles ; a grandson of Eitoku , Tanyu KANO , who moved from Kyoto to Edo and supervised the creation of screen paintings of Edo Castle and Nijo Castle ; Sanraku KANO , who stayed in Kyoto , thus representing a group called ' Kyo Kano . ' 
Once the structure of the Edo shogunate had become stable , the members of the Kanoha group were driven to get extensive orders done for screen paintings of the Imperial Palace and castles as the shogunate 's official painters . 
In order to fulfill large numbers of orders for screen paintings , the head of the Kano family needed to lead the painters so they could work in a group . 
Consequently , the painters of the Kanoha group needed to learn ancestral painting examples and ways of painting without expressing their individuality as painters . 
Given such an historical backdrop , it can be said that the Kanoha group after Tanyu KANO only tried to keep the tradition and maintain influence as official painters , and therefore lost its artistic drive . 
In the present day , an artist 's expression of individuality and mentality is valued , so the evaluation of paintings of the Kanoha group is not necessarily high . 
However , it is a fact that the Kanoha group led the Japanese art world for about four centuries and that numbers of painters were developed by the group ; thus one can hardly discuss the history of Japanese painting but exclude the Kanoha group , whether in positive or negative terms . 
It is also a fact that many Japanese painters after the early years of the modern age were influenced by the Kanoha group and started with the influence of the Kanoha group ; initially , Korin OGATA , of the Rinpa group , and Okyo MARUYAMA of the Shaseiha group had learned from the Kanoha group . 
The Kanoha group was founded by Masanobu KANO ( c . 1434 - 1530 ) , who worked as the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate . 
He lived quite long for a Japanese of the time ( it is commonly believed that he died at age 97 ) , and worked from the middle of the fifteenth century until the early sixteenth century . 
It is said that he was from the Izu area , but that is uncertain . 
Due to the progress of study after the late twentieth century , it is speculated that the Kano family was somehow related to the Nagao clan in Ashikaga , Shimotsuke Province ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) ; and " Waterfall , " an ink painting that remains at Chorin-ji Temple in Ashikaga City , is considered a relatively early work by Masanobu . 
The first painting work recorded as having been done by Masanobu is the screen paintings he did of the Deity of Mercy and Luohan in Unchoin , Shokoku-ji Temple Tower , which he did in Kyoto at the age of 30 in 1463 . This was just before the turmoil of the Onin War ( 1467 - 1477 ) ( as reported in Inryoken Nichiroku ( Inryoken 's Diary ) ) , which tells us that Masanobu was already working as a painter in Kyoto by that time . 
Shokoku-ji Temple , as the main temple building of Unchoin , where Masanobu created the screen paintings , is a Zendera temple constructed by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , the third Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate ; it is the heart of the Muromachi art world , which produced artist-monks such as Josetsu , Shubun , Sesshu ; moreover , in those days Sotan ( Sotan OGURI , 1413 - 1481 ) , an artist-monk who was a disciple of Shubun , worked as an official painter . 
Although it is not exactly certain when Masanobu KANO went to Kyoto , whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , it is clear ( according to certain records ) that Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate , gave him an important position . 
In 1481 , a few years after the tumultuous Onin War ( 1467 - 1477 ) , which had lasted for a decade , Sotan , the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , died ; thus it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate , succeeding Sotan . 
Subsequently , Mitsunobu TOSA , of the Yamatoe group ( a style of Japanese painting ) who was in the postion of Edokoro-azukari ( a leader of painters who worked for the Imperial Court ) of the Imperial Court , and Masanobu KANO of the Kanga ( a Chinese style of painting ) group , became two major forces in the art world . 
In 1482 , the former Shogun , Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , started the construction of Higashiyama dono ( the predecessor of Ginkaku-ji Temple ) , and Masanobu took charge of the screen paintings . 
Following the death of Yoshimasa in 1490 , Masanobu worked for the Hosokawa clan , which had political power at the time . 
In this way Masanobu solidified his position in the art world while deepening his relationship with the powers-that-be , and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the Kanoha group . 
According to records , it is known that Masanobu created works in various styles and subjects , including screen paintings and Buddhist paintings ; however , all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll . 
His painting style was ' kanga , ' with ink painting based on the brushwork of Sung and Yuan in China , in contrast to the traditional Yamatoe of his contemporary , Mitsunobu TOSA . 
Although Masanobu lived until age 97 , it is n't clear what work he produced during the last 30 years , and it seems he had his heir Motonobu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement . 
The second generation , Motonobu KANO ( 1476 - 1559 ) , who built the basis of prosperity of the Kanoha group , was the heir of Masanobu . 
His best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin , Daitoku-ji Temple ( the hojo , or chief priest 's room , was completed in 1513 ) and another one in Reiunin , Myoshin-ji Temple in 1543 ( it is widely believed that the screen paintings in Daisenin were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period ) . 
The creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin was divided among Soami , Motonobu and his brother Yukinobu KANO , depending on the room ; accordingly , Motonobu took charge of " Four Seasons , Flowers and Birds " in ' Danna no Ma ' and " Founder of the Zenshu sect " in ' Ihatsu no Ma . ' 
" Founder of Zenshu sect " is a typical ink painting , while " Four Seasons , Flowers and Birds " is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time , as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds . 
Motonobu strengthened the ties with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa clan as the powers-that-be , had numerous disciples and consolidated the basis of the Kanoha as a group of painters . 
He accepted orders from court nobles , temples and shrines as well as samurai families ; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in Osaka according to the historical record , but this no longer exists . 
Because Motonobu referred to himself as ' Echizen no kami ' in his later life , he was given a priestly rank called ' Hogen ' however , for posterity he has been referred to as ' Kohogen ' or ' Echizen Hogen . ' 
The work is wide-ranging : he created the Engi Emaki of temples and shrines , votive pictures , gilded folding screens in the Yamatoe style , and portraits as well as screen paintings . 
Motonobu assumed the Yamatoe painting style in Kanga and ink painting ( in which his father Masanobu specialized ) ; he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a Fusuma ( Japanese sliding door ) and a folding screen , and built a foundation for the style of the Kanoha group . 
He is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as Shintai ( standard style ) , Gyotai ( semi-cursive style ) , and Sotai ( cursive style ) . 
Motonobu had three sons : Munenobu , Hideyori and Naonobu ; Naonobu ( 1519 - 1592 ) ; the first , Munenobu , died young , and the third son Naonobu succeeded as the head of family . 
It is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son Naonobu instead of Hideyori , the second son . 
Naonobu is widely known as Shoei KANO ( his posthumous name ) , and he was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period . 
The huge " Nirvana " ( six meters long ) in Daitoku-ji Temple is his finest work . 
Although he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with his father Motonobu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the Jukoin , Daitoku-ji Temple with his son Eitoku , he was a less famous artist because his father Motonobu and his son Eitoku were more prominent . 
Eitoku KANO ( 1543 - 1590 ) , the heir of Shoei , is also called Kuninobu ; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the Japanese art world from the Momoyama period . 
Although he created numbers of screen paintings in strict compliance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild times--including Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI--these paintings were lost with the buildings , so relatively few of Eitoku 's works remain in existence . 
The paintings on the partitions in the hojo of Jukoin , Daitoku-ji Temple ( which are among his best existing works ) were created by Eitoku together with his father Shoei ; however , Shoei had Eitoku take charge of Fusumae of the major room in the south front of the hojo , while he took a supporting role . 
In the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create Fusumae in the major room , so it is historically believed that , at the time such paintings were created , Shoei had already retired after transferring the family estate to Eitoku , who was a great talent . 
" Flowers and Birds " in Shitchu ( the center front room of Hojo ) is very highly acclaimed among the screen paintings of Hojo of Jukoin . 
Subsequently , Eitoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle Tower , which Nobunaga ODA constructed during the period from 1576 to 1579 . 
He created screen paintings in the Osaka Castle of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Jurakudai after Nobunaga died , and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the Imperial Palace . 
These works were highly acclaimed for their originality in the journals and records of the time , so they would be Eitoku 's best works if they existed ; however , these paintings were lost with the buildings . 
As Eitoku 's existing best works , the screen paintings in the hojo of Jukoin , as previously described , are renowned as well as " Foo dogs , folding screen " as former imperial property , and " Urban and suburb of Kyoto , folding screen , " as handed down through the Uesugi clan ; it has also been said that " Cypress , folding screen " in the Tokyo National Museum was painted by Eitoku . 
Eitoku excelled at elaborate paintings and monumental paintings , although he had no choice but to paint in the monumental painting style in order to fill a large number of orders for screen paintings . 
An elaborate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail , and monumental painting is interpreted as having a high-minded style . 
The Kanoha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages . 
" Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao , " a designated national treasure , has the seal of ' Hideyori ' ; it has been said that this was painted by Hideyori KANO ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the second son of Motonobu KANO ; however , it is also said that this ' Hideyori ' of " Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao " is another painter called Hideyori SHINSHO , a grandson of Motonobu . 
Soshu KANO ( 1551 - 1601 ) was a brother of Eitoku , also called Motohide , and worked as an assistant to Eitoku in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle . 
Folding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him . 
Naganobu KANO ( 1577 - 1654 ) , another brother of Eitoku , is renowned as the painter of " Playing Under the Flowering Trees , " a national treasure . 
As painters other than the direct line of the Kano family , Yoshinobu KANO ( 1552 - 1640 ) , who painted " Craftspeople , folding screen " in Kawagoe Kitain , and Naizen KANO ( 1570 - 1616 ) , who painted " Hokoku Festival , folding screen " in Kyoto Toyokuni-jinja Shrine ( Kyoto City ) , are well known . 
Eitoku KANO died at age 48 , preceding his father Shoei ( Naonobu ) . 
Eitoku 's first son Mitsunobu KANO ( c . 1565 - 1608 ) and second son Takanobu KANO ( 1571 - 1618 ) succeeded him . 
Mitsunobu created the screen paintings in the Reception Hall of Kangakuin , Onjo-ji Temple ; in contrast to Eitoku he specialized in delicate painting in the Yamatoe style . 
Such a style of painting might not have suited the public taste at the time , and the early modern essays on paintings , including " Honchogashi , " generally put a low value on Mitsunobu . 
After the death of the Kano family head Mitsunobu , his brother Takanobu led the Kanoha group because his son Sadanobu KANO ( 1597 - 1623 ) was only 12 years of age . 
Under the feudal system , the family line of Sadanobu , Mitsunobu 's first son , was supposed to be the head of family ; however , Sadanobu died without an heir at the age of just 27 , so after that the legitimacy of the Kano family was the descendant of Takanobu till the end of the Edo period . 
Takanobu had three sons--Morinobu ( Tanyu 1602 - 1674 ) , Naonobu KANO ( 1607 - 1650 ) and Yasunobu KANO ( 1613 - 1685 ) --and they respectively became the earliest ancestor of the Kajibashi Kano family , Kobikicho Kano family and Nakabashi Kano family . 
Although the youngest son , Yasunobu , succeeded as the Kano head of family as an adopted son of Sadanobu ( mentioned above ) , the most renowned painter was Morinobu ( also known as Tanyu ) . 
Morinobu later became a priest and called himself Tanyusai ; as a painter he is known as Tanyu KANO . 
He eventually moved to Edo and solidified the position of the Kanoha group in the art world more as the official painter of the Edo shogunate . 
Tanyu exercised his painting talent from childhood ; in 1612 , he met Ieyasu TOKUNAGA in Sunpu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in Edo Kajibashi Mongai in 1621 , subsequent to which he worked based in Edo and energetically created screen paintings in castles and large temples . 
Among Tanyu 's works , the screen paintings in the Edo and Osaka castles were lost with the buildings , but the screen paintings ( ink paintings ) in Jorakuden of Nagoya Castle are existent , having avoided an air raid during World War II because they had been removed from the building and evacuated ; additionally , the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle and the hojo of Daitoku-ji Temple are among his best existent works . 
He created various kinds of works , including hanging rolls , picture scrolls and folding screens , as well as these large paintings . 
He created the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle when he was young ( 25 years of age ) , and they showed dynamism in Eitoku 's style ; however , the screen paintings in Daitoku-ji Temple , which he created later in his life ( mainly with ink and water ) , display a calm approach with abundant use of blank space . 
He had works in the Yamatoe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well . 
Tanyu emphasized sketches and the copying of ancient paintings ; consequently , he left numerous sketch books and reproduction books . 
Many of Tanyu 's copies of ancient paintings ( called ' Tanyu Reduction ' ) are existent , which are now part of museums and collections around the nation , and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose originals are now lost , so they are valuable as data for the study of Japanese art history . 
The Kanoha group during the Edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a consanguinity group mainly with the head family of the Kano family and numerous disciples around the nation , thus comprising a hierarchy . 
They are clearly ranked : under the most prestigious four families ( called ' inner court painters ' ) there are about 15 families less prestigious called ' outer court painters ' and then the ' Machi Kano painters ' who catered to the demands of townspeople instead of the Imperial Court or temples and shrines ; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation . 
The powers of the time sought the stability and continuity of feudal society , and the paintings for public places such as Edo Castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples ; they were not intended to be unique . 
In order to create numbers of screen paintings , one must work in a group with all the disciples ; therefore , in order to make group work easier , the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one 's individuality as a painter . 
In this respect it is undeniable that the paintings of the Kanoha group lack individuality and originality . 
It is said that the inner court painters ranked with Hatamoto and were allowed ' audience ' with the Shogun as well as belting on a sword , which implies a high status . 
The four families of the inner court painters are the Kajibashi family , with lineage of Tanyu ( the first son of Takanobu KANO ) ; the Kobikicho family ( called Takekawa-cho family at the time ) , with lineage of Naonobu ( the second son of Takanobu ) ; the Nakabashi family with lineage of Yasunobu ( the third son of Takanobu ) ; and the Hamacho family , with lineage of Minenobu KANO ( 1662 - 1708 ) ( Minenobu is the second son of Tsunenobu KANO , the first son of Naonobu KANO ) . 
Because Tanyu had no child , he adopted Toun ( Masunobu KANO 1625 - 1694 ) , the son of Ryujo GOTO , a swordsmith . 
Later , Morimasa KANO ( 1653 - 1718 ) who was his biological son ( born after Tanyu turned 50 ) succeeded him , but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter . 
Among the numerous disciples of Tanyu , Morikage KUSUMI ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the creator of " Enjoying the Cool of the Evening Under the Moonflower Trellis , " is renowned . 
Morikage was for some reason expelled from the Kanoha group ; he worked in the Kanazawa area later , but his records are n't completely clear . 
As stated previously , the head family of Kano was succeeded by the Nakabashi Family of Yasunobu , a brother of Tanyu . 
Tokinobu KANO ( 1642 - 1678 ) , a son of Yasunobu , died in his thirties , and his son Ujinobu KANO ( 1675 - 1724 ) succeeded the family estate ; however , subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter . 
Itcho HANABUSA ( 1652 - 1724 ) , who was popular based on his sophisticated painting style , was a disciple of Yasunobu . 
The family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the Edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the Kobikicho family , of Naonobu 's lineage . 
This family line produced Tsunenobu KANO ( 1636 - 1713 ) , the heir of Naonobu , and Tsunenobu 's sons , Chikanobu KANO ( 1660 - 1728 ) and Minenobu KANO ( 1662 - 1708 ) . 
Minenobu won the favor of the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA , and he later gained independence as ' Hamacho family , ' which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families . 
Besides them , Koi KANO ( date of birth unknown - 1636 ) was not related by blood to the Kano family but , along with his brothers , was a master of Tanyu ; he was allowed to use the surname of Kano due to his achievements , and he worked for the Kishu Tokugawa family . 
Meanwhile , a group called ' Kyo Kano ' remained active in Kyoto , and Sanraku KANO ( 1559 - 1635 ) , a disciple of Eitoku KANO , was the pillar of the group . 
Sanraku was from the Kimura clan in Omi , the vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI ; his original name was Mitsuyori KIMURA . 
His best works are " Peonies " and " Red and White Plum Trees " in the main house of Kyoto Daikaku-ji Temple , and they have colorful and decorative pictures on a golden base . 
Sansetsu KANO ( 1589 / 90 - 1651 ) , the husband of Sanraku 's daughter , created the screen paintings in Tenkyuin , Myoshin-ji Temple as well as some paintings of folding screens , which are still in existence . 
He had a distinctive painting style unique among painters of the Kanoha group , such as distinct shapes of trees and rocks , as well as the completeness of detail . 
The essay on paintings made by Sansetsu and edited by his son Eino KANO ( 1631 - 1697 ) is entitled " Honchogashi , " the first full-fledge painting history book by a Japanese . 
The Kobikicho family produced Michinobu KANO ( Michinobu EISENIN ( 1730 - 1790 ) ) , Korenobu KANO ( Korenobu YOSENIN ( 1753 - 1808 ) ) , Naganobu KANO ( Naganobu ISENIN ( 1775 - 1828 ) ) and Osanobu KANO ( Osanobu SEISENIN ( 1786 - 1846 ) ) during the late Edo period . 
Osanobu SEISENIN led the creation of numerous screen paintings as a master of the Kanoha group during the reconstruction of the Nishinomaru and Honmaru palaces of Edo Castle , which had burned down in 1838 and again in 1844 . 
Although the paintings are no longer in existence , numerous designs are in the possession of the Tokyo National Museum . 
SEISENIN also endeavored to copy and collect ancient paintings . 
Although the painters of the Kanoha group in the late Edo period are not well appreciated generally , there is a move to reappraise SEISENIN as the progress of the study after the late twentieth century recognizes that he was a painter with good technique who eagerly studied art from ancient paintings and on to the new painting movement at the end of the Edo period . 
Hogai KANO ( born in Shimonoseki , 1828 - 1888 ) , a leading figure of the Japanese art world during the early Meiji period , like Gaho HASHIMOTO ( born in Kawagoe , 1835 - 1908 ) , was a disciple of Tadanobu KANO ( Tadanobu SHOSEN 'IN 1823 - 1880 ) , the next generation of SEISENIN . 
Both Hogai and Gaho were from painter families of the Kanoha group . 
The historical role of the Kanoha group as a professional painter group finished as its patron , the Edo shogunate , ended . 
Personal information of Emperor SHIRAKAWA 
Emperor SHIRAKAWA ( 7th July 1053 - 24th July 1129 ) was the 72nd Emperor . 
SHIRAKAWA came to power on the 18th January 1073 and reigned until 5th anuary 1087 . 
His posthumous name was Sadahito . 
SHIRAKAWA was the first son of Emperor Go-Sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the Fujiwara Five Regent Houses , and his mother , Nyogo , FUJIWARA no Moshi / Shigeko was from Fujiwara Kaninryu , the daughter of Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kinnari , and the adopted daughter of Togu Daibu FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu . 
His half sister was Princess Tokushi / Atsuko ( Empress of Horikawa ) 
Genealogy 
When he was young , he and his father were snubbed due to their background , but after his father was enthroned in 1068 ( Jiryaku 4 ) , he was proclaimed a Shinno ( Imperial prince ) and became Imperial Prince Sadahito . 
In 1069 he became Crown Prince , and became an Emperor three years later , when he was twenty years old . 
A Kanpaku was assigned , but SHIRAKAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done , after his father , the retired Emperor , died of illness in 1070 ( Jiryaku 5 ) , and also attempted to regulate the Shoen ( manor ) system thereby trying to weaken the influence of the Regent / Kanpaku Houses . 
Go-Sanjo-in and Go-Sanjo-in 's mother , Yomeimon-in , wished for SHIRAKAWA 's younger half brother , Prince Sanehito ( Heian period ) and then Sanehito 's younger brother Prince Sukehito to succeed to the throne , and upon abdication to SHIRAKAWA , Prince Sanehito was decided to become Crown Prince . 
SHIRAKARA repelled against this and later Prince Sanehiro died from illness in 1085 ( Otoku 2 ) . 
As a result , in November , 1086 ( Otoku 3 ) , SHIRAKAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son , Prince Taruhito ( 73rd Emperor Horikawa ) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Sukehito and SHIRAKAWA abdicated immediately . 
Retired Emperor SHIRAKAWA , who became Daijo Tenno , acted as the guardian of the young Emperor , and ruled personally as Shirakawa-in , and this style of government became known as Insei system ( cloistered style ) . 
Through such system , although the Sessho and Kampaku offices continued , they did not have actual power to rule the government . 
SHIRAKAWA continued to have exert power even after Emperor Horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his despotic position by appointing aids from the Juryro and Samurai class . 
The Samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the " Hokumen no bushi " which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor . 
SHIRAKAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yukan after the death of his daughter in 1096 ( Kaho 3 ) . 
SHIRAKAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the Hossho-ji Temple , and he took advantage of getting finance from Juryo . 
After Emperor Horikawa died , SHIRAKAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors , until he died on 24th July 1129 ( 7th July Taiji 4 ) , and he supported both his grandson 74th Emperor Toba and his great grandson 75th Emperor Sutoku . 
This is called " Chiten no kimi " . 
The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa had supreme power , but it was said he mented that , he has no control over the following three things : 1 . Waters of the Kamo River ( tributary of the Yodo River ) ( due to its flow and frequent flooding ) ; 2 . Dice used in sugoroku ( different from current sugoroku , close to western backgammon ) , which was popular way of gambling at that time , with spots on the dice selecting winners / losers ; and 3 . Yamaboshi ( monk soldiers from Mt . Hie Enryaku-ji Temple ) , which show that SHIRAKAWA had absolute control apart from these three things . 
SHIRAKAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that Emperor Sutoku and TAIRA no Kiyomori may be SHIRAKAWA 's illegitimate sons , was widely spread and believed at the time .

All the past Emperors are enshrined in Koreiden , one of the Three Palace Sanctuaries . 
Emperor Shirakawa initially wished to be buried after his death , and often mentioned this to his people , but he suddenly ordered to be cremated , when he learnt that the body of FUJIWARA no Moromichi , who was buried , was in the danger of being humiliated by monk soldiers of Kofuku-ji Temple , who were known to be opposed to Moromichi when Moromichi was alive , and planned to attack and open Moromichi 's grave . 
It is said the Emperor 's body was cremated in the Kita district , Kyoto City at a crematorium , monument of which still exists near the Kinkaku Elementary School .

The Kujo Family is one of the Sekke and a court noble . 
The progenitor of this family was Kanezane KUJO , the third son of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi , a direct descendant of the Fujiwara-hokke ( the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan ) . 
The family name comes from the fact that the Kujo Family lived in Kujo-den , which was located in Kyoto Kujo and said to have been built by FUJIWARA no Mototsune . 
This individual was a duke after the Meiji Restoration . 
The crest is Kujo-Fuji Crest . 
A descendant of FUJIWARA no Kanefusa ( grand minister of state ) , the younger brother-uterine of Kanezane , he is sometimes included in the Kujo family but Kanefusa 's family line failed at an early stage . 
The children of Michiie KUJO , a grandchild of Kanezane--Norizane KUJO , Yoshizane KUJO and Sanetsune KUJO--became regents to the emperor and started the Kujo Family , Nijo Family and Ichijo Family , respectively , thus constituting Gosekke . 
Kanezane KUJO inherited the fief of the elder sister by a different mother , Kokamonin , which became the foundation of the Kujo Family fiefdom . 
Kanezane was critical of the Taira clan administration and Pope Goshirakawa ; he became regent by recommendation of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo and then chief advisor to the Emperor , whereupon the Konoe and Kujo families took positions as regents to the emperor . 
Kanezane 's grandson , Michiie KUJO , gained power in the Imperial court since Michiie 's son Yoritsune KUJO , and then Yoritsune 's son Yoritsugu KUJO , became Sekke Shogun in the Kamakura Shogunate . 
Kanezane 's diary , " Gyokuyo ( Kanezane KUJO 's Diary ) , " is famous . 
The Kujo family 's fiefdom continued to expand during medieval times . They held the lordship of Karoku , an area of land that yielded 2,000 koku of rice in the Edo era and 3,000 koku later on , until the Meiji era . 
Setsuko , the fourth daughter of the duke Michitaka KUJO , who was Hisatada KUJO 's firstborn , became empress to the Emperor Taisho ( Empress Teimei ) . 
Conflict over legitimate blood between the Kujo and Ichijo families 
Michiie KUJO lost the legitimate heir , Norizane KUJO , and the second son , Yoshizane KUJO , was practically repudiated . 
Michiie gave Tadaie KUJO , Norizane 's son and Michiie 's grandchild , to be the legitimate heir , a shobunjo ( a kind of will ) to give instructions that documents such as diaries ( which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time ) should be inherited by the Ichijo Family , but that the head of a family who controls the family temples such as Tofuku-ji Temple should first be inherited by Sanetsune ICHIJO , the third son of Michiie , then by Tadaie KUJO , a child of the eldest son of Michiie , and later by either descendant of the Kujo Family or the Ichijo Family who took the highest-ranking official position ( head of a clan ) . 
In accordance with Michiie 's will , Sanetsune ICHIJO 's descendant inherited the position as head of the family after Michiie died . 
Thereafter , the predominance of the Ichijo Family was maintained for over 100 years , whereby the position of the Ichijo Family as legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu ( Kujo family line ) was well established . 
When Tsunemichi ICHIJO died in 1365 ( the Hokucho period ) , during the Muromachi era , Tsunenori KUJO--who had gained the second position of power after the Ichijo Family--made an appeal to the Emperor Gokogon that Fusatsune ICHIJO , a son of Tsunemichi , had fraudulently identified himself as the head of family . 
At that time , primogeniture was becoming the common practice , and Tsunenori claimed that according to primogeniture the Kujo Family , the descendant of the eldest son of Michiie , should inherit the family estate . 
Fusatsune ICHIJO argued against Tsunenori , stating that just because an ancestor of the Kujo Family was the firstborn child it did not mean the Kujo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu , and that because Michiie KUJO gave the family estate to Sanetsune ICHIJO , the Tokado-bunko ( Gonnjo-moromichi-ki ) ( Gonijo-moromichi record ) , Gyokuyo ( Kanezane KUJO 's diary ) and Gyokuzui ( Michiie KUJO 's diary ) ) and the document endorsing the political authority of Kujo-ryu Sekkan-ke , a regent family , were inherited by the ICHIJO Family ; whereas Tsunenori KUJO asserted that measures to give inheritance to Sanetsune were taken just because Tadaie KUJO was in infancy , and that if Norizane KUJO had lived longer it would not have happened . 
Tunenori further asserted that Tadaie KUJO was named as the receiver of the shobunjo ( executor of the will ) and the land patent of the premise of Tofuku-ji Temple had been inherited by the Kujo Family because the Kujo was the legitimate blood . 
Considering the political position of the Kujo Family at that time , the emperor gave Rinji to the Kujo Family on November 29 ( lunar calendar ) , in the same year giving the verdict that the will of Michiie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the Kujo and Ichijo families , both having the qualification , were on equal footing as legitimate blood . 
The Ichijo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu during the Kamakura era , but after the middle Muromachi period the position of the Kujo Family was elevated and the Ichijo and Kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu . 
The Kujo Family started inheriting the Matsudono Family 's fiefdom after the Middle Edo period ; thus the Kujo possessed the largest Kokudaka , lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu .

Old Kujo-tei was in the southwest area of the present-day Kyoto Gyoen . 
Today only the garden remains , on the basis of maintenance . 
Itsukushima-jinja Shrine , which was then called Chinju-sha , still exists on the island of the garden pond ( KUJO-ike ) , and a simple but elegant tearoom called Shusui-tei is found near the pond . 
The major buildings ( such as the main building ) were transferred to Kujo-tei in Tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early Meiji era , and were recently donated by the Kujo Family to the Tokyo National Museum , which was named Kujo-kan . 
Yamashiro no Kuni , located in Kinai , was one of the administrative province ( Ryoseikoku ) . 
It was situated in the southern part of present day Kyoto . 
It was also called Joshu ( unusually it is also alled Sanshu ) or Yoshu . 
In the Engishiki , it is ranked as Kokushi-kuni tokyu ( a Kokushi ( official ) governing province ) . 
" Yamashiro " was written as 山代 in ancient times , and in the 7th century , the province ( kuni ) was founded with the name written as 山背国 . 
On November 8 , 794 ( Enryaku 13 ) , when the capital was named Heian-kyo ( Heian Palace ) , the Emperor Kammu changed the second letter of the province 's name to 山城国 
Based on the writings of " mokkan " -strips of wood used for writing during the Heijo-kyo ( Heijo Palace ) period , the notations of Yamashiro no Kuni as 山代国 and 山背国 seem to have coexisted with 山城国 . 
According to Wamyo Ruijusho , the provincial government office ( Kokufu ) was situated at the Kaya Imperial Villa ( Kaya Detached Palace ) . 
On the other hand , it is recorded as " Otokuni-gun ( Otokuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) " in Shugaisho . 
In the colophon and afterward titled " Keicho-two Enirinshi " of Setsuyoshu ( proofed by Ekirin ) it is also recorded as " Otokuni-gun ( Otokuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) . " 
As for Shugosho ( governor 's office ) , at first , the mansion of the Gokenin of Kyoto Shugo ( Kyoto governor ) was designated because the person holding the post of Kyoto Shugo concurrently took charge of Yamashiro Province 's Shugo . 
Later , Rokuhara Tandai held the post of the Province Shugo , and therefore , the office ( Shugosho ) was moved to Rokuhara . 
In Muromachi period , the Yamashiro Province was divided along the Uji River into three upper districts and five lower districts ; after an associate shugo ( shugodai ) was designated to each district the Shugosho in charge of the three upper districts was situated in Uji Makishima , while Shugosho for the five lower districts were placed in several places such as Yodo . 
Ichinomiya ( primary shrine ) , Provincial monastery ( temple ) , and Others 
The provincial temple -with monastery for priests as well as convent for priestess- , were located in Soraku District . 
The Daigokuden Hall of the Kuni no Miya Shrine was designated as a monastery ( soji ) in 746 . 
It was burned down in 882 . 
Afterwards it was reconstructed but its influence declined . 
In Kamakura period , it seems that the temple was categorized as the lowest level temple within the Byodo-in school 
The provincial temple was located at present day Kamo-cho , Kizugawa city . 
In 1925 ( 14th year of Taisho ) a large number of old [ roof ] tiles were excavated near the provincial temple , and implying that there was a convent there . 
In Engi-Shiki Jinmei-cho ( shrines ' name directory ) a total of 122-za and 96-sha are recorded , consisting of 53-za / 37-sha of taisha ( big shrines ) ( within these shrines , 23-za / 16-sha of dai myojin are included ) and 69-za / 59-sha of shosha ( small shrines ) . In addition to these shrines , 36-za ( 30 big za , and 6 small za ) in the imperial court and 3-daiza in Kyoto are also registered . 
Kamo Shrines are the first shrines ( Ichinomiya ) in Kyoto -Kamowakeikazuchi Shrine ( called Kamigamo Shrine ) at Kita district , and Kamomioya Shrine ( called Shimogamo Shrine ) at Sakyo district . 
Unlike in other local provinces , it is considered that Jingi-kan had some influence over the designation of the first shrine ( Ichinomiya ) in Yamashiro Province ; because of this , while the establishment of Ichinomiya in other provinces took place starting at the end of the 11th century the designation of Ichinomiya in Kinai ( Kansai Region ) began during the 12th century . 
There is no secondary ( Ninomiya ) and lower level shrines . 
As for the soja shrine , the information is not available .

The Ikedaya Incident is the name given to an event that took place on July 8,1864 towards the end of the Edo Period in which the Shinsen-gumi , who was a peacekeeping organization under the Kyoto protectorate , attacked the imperial loyalist faction from Choshu who were hiding out at the Ikedaya Inn at Kiyamachi ( Sanjou-Kobashi Bridge ) on Sanjou-Street in Kyoto . 
It is also known as the Ikedaya Rebellion , the Ikedaya Uprising , or the Sanjou-kobashi Disturbance . 
Isami KONDO called it the Rakuyo Upheaval in his writings . 
Kyoto at the end of the Edo period was the center of political power struggles , and ronins ( masterless samurai ) from different feudal clans who held such ideas as " revere the emperor , expel foreigners " and imperialists were active behind the scenes . 
The Choshu clan was overthrown by the Aizu and Satsuma clans in a coup on August 18th , and the Shogunate-Imperial faction became the mainstream in the imperial court . 
The " revere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction was trying to recover its strength , and the Kyoto protectorate used the Shinsen-gumi for security and searches in the city . 
At around the end of May , moderators and observers including Susumu YAMAZAKI and Kai SHIMADA ascertained the presence of Masuya store ( Shuntaro FURUTAKA ) that was operating a charcoal business in Shijo-Kobashi-Agaru-Shin-cho , and made a report to the Aizu clan . 
Weapons and communications with the Choshu clan were found . 
The Shinsen-gumi captors requested Toshizo HIJIKATA to torture FURUTAKA , who was coerced into a confession . 
The plan was to wait for a windy day before the Gion festival and set fire to the Kyoto Imperial Palace , and in the ensuing confusion confining Prince Asahiko NAKAGAWANOMIYA ( who became Asahiko KUNINOMIYA later ) , assassinate Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI ( Yoshinobu TUGAWA ) and Katamori MATSUDAIRA of the Aizu clan , and take Emperor Koumyou to Choshu . 
Furthermore , the search revealed that the loyalists from the Choshu , Tosa , and Higo clans were planning to hold a meeting at Ikedaya or Shikokuya to discuss whether or not to go forward with the plan of attack after hearing about the arrest of FURUTAKA . 
The Shinsen-gumi had asked for support from the Aizu , Kuwana , and other clans , but their actions were too slow , and they did not move when the time came . 
That is why the boss , Isami KONDO , knowing that every moment counted , acted alone by splitting their members into two squads under KONDO and HIJIKATA and began the search . 
At the time , the Shinsen-gumi was short-handed because many members were sick , so only 34 members took part in the search - 10 in the KONDO squad and 24 in the HIJIKATA squad ( There are different views on the number. cf . List of Soldiers Involved ) . 
The HIJIKATA squad , a part of the Shinsen-gumi , searched Nawate Street from Yasaka Shrine , while the KONDO squad searched Kiyamachi Street across the Sanjo Bridge . 
At the end of the search , the KONDO squad found radical nationalists who were having a meeting at Ikedaya . 
A few members of the KONDO squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night . 
Four of the members - Isami KONDO , Soji OKITA , Shinpachi NAGAKURA , and Heisuke TODO - first attacked the 20-some radical nationalists while the rest shored up the perimeter . 
Some ronins frantically attacked Hayatarou ANDO , Eisuke OKUZAWA and Kakuzaemon NITTA who guarded the back door , and succeeded to escape . 
OKUZAWA died in the attack , and ANDO and NITTA died a month later . 
OKITA went inside the building and fought hard , but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it . 
Some accounts say that this was because of a tuberculosis-related blood spitting , but there is a lot of doubt and it is not certain . 
Then , a sword hit the forehead of TODO on the first floor when sweat caused his helmet to slip out of place , and he withdrew from the battle . 
Although there were KONDO and NAGAKURA only at one point , the arrival of the HIJIKATA squad tilted the odds in favor of the Shinsen-gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested . 
Aizu and Kuwana clans arrived there to support them after the battle . 
HIJIKATA would not let them anywhere near , to ensure that they could not take credit . 
Although some of the radical nationalists escaped from the battle , the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out clearing operations with Aizu , Kuwana , and other clans . 
The sweep of the city turned violent , and there were 5 immediate deaths among the Aizu clan , four among the Hikone clan , and two among the Kuwana clan . 
At noon of the following day , the Shinsen-gumi returned to their base in Mibu Village . ( If they had returned to their base at night , they might have fallen into an ambush , so they took a rest in the city until dawn . ) 
It is said that the roadside was crowded with onlookers . 
The name of the Shinsen-gumi , which succeeded in preventing the plot to burn down the imperial palace , became famous throughout the land . 
The " revere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction , on the other hand , took a big blow with the deaths of such important activists as Toshimaro YOSHIDA , Kichima KITAZOE , Teizo MIYABE , Matajiro OTAKA , Junjiro ISHIKAWA , Matsusuke SUGIYAMA and Jusuke MATSUDA . ( They were later called the " Seven Martyrs " by the new government . ) 
Kogoro KATSURA ( later Takayoshi KIDO ) should have been there too , but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while . His life had been spared because the incident occurred before he came back . 
Beginning with this incident , the Choshu clan fell under the influence of zealots and later came to Kyoto and raised the Kinmon rebellion on July 19 ( in the old calendar ) . 
It has been said that the Ikedaya Incident delayed the Meiji Restoration by a year . There is also another opinion that it sped up the Restoration by stirring up the " revere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction . 
Author Ryotaro SHIBA 's interpretation is that the Meiji Restoration led by the four major clans of Satsuma , Choshu , Tosa , and Bizen would never have happened without this incident .

Murasaki Shikibu ( dates of birth and death unknown ) was a female author and poet in the mid-Heian period . 
She is well known as the author of " The Tale of Genji . " 
She is one of the Chuko Sanjurokkasen ( medieval 36 Immortal Poets ) . 
Her poem , ' I met a friend after so long , who went back in a hurry before I recognized his face ; like the moon goes behind a cloud at a blow ' was selected for " Ogura Hyakunin isshu ( One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets ) . " 
She was from the Fujiwara clan , and her name as a court lady was ' Fuji Shikibu ( Murasaki Shikibu ) . ' 
She acquired the sobriquet of ' Murasaki ' from the name of the heroine ' Murasaki no Ue ' of " The Tale of Genji , " and ' Shikibu ' refers to her father 's position as Shikibutaijo ( Aide of Ceremonials ) . 
Murasaki Shikibu 's real name is unknown , but it is assumed that she was the ' FUJIWARA no Kaoriko / Takako / Koshi , ' who became shoji ( ranked ) on January 29 , 1007 , which was described in ' Mido Kanpakuki ( FUJIWARA no Michinaga 's diary ) . ' 
However this view is generally based on the other assumptions , which are said to contain errors in the process of making inferences , so it remains a matter of conjecture . 
Also , her dates of birth and death are unknown , but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 1008 , based on historical materials and her works ; by counting backwards from that age , she would have been born around 979 and died around 1016 . 
Tradition has it that she liked sardines , which was unusual for aristocracy , but this episode is based on a story of Izumi Shikibu in ' Sarugenji no soshi ( The Sarugenji Book ) , ' so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date . 
She was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tametoki , governor of Echigo Province , and her mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tamenobu from Settsu Province , but she lost her mother when she was little . 
FUJIWARA no Nobunori was her brother by a different father , and apparently she also had an older sister . 
FUJIWARA no Sadakata , Sanjo Udaijin ( Sanjo minister of the right ) , and FUJIWARA no Kanesuke , Tsutsumi Chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) , were her paternal great grandfathers , and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers . 
There are many anecdotes stating that , since her childhood , she had had more talent for reading Chinese classics than women were required to have in those days . 
It is generally considered that she wrote both " The Tale of Genji , " which consists of 54 chapters , and " Murasaki Shikibu Diary , " which was about her days in service to the Imperial Court , as well as " Collection of Murasaki Shikibu 's Works . " 
Her father , FUJIWARA no Tametoki , obtained employment as a reader in Togu ( the palace of the Crown Prince ) while in his thirties , and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo ( Chamberlain ) and then to Shikibutaijo ; however , when the Emperor became a priest , he lost his job . 
Ten years later , as a consequence of dedicating a poem to Emperor Ichijo , he became a governor of Echizen Province . 
Murasaki Shikibu , during her childhood , spent two years in the place of her father 's assignment . 
In about 998 , she married a governor of Yamashiro Province FUJIWARA no Nobutaka , who was old enough to be her father ; in 999 she bore him a daughter , FUJIWARA no Kataiko / Kenshi , but this marriage life did n't last long because Nobutaka died soon afterward . 
In December 29 ( according to the lunar calendar ) of 1005 , she began serving the Empress of Emperor Ichijo FUJIWARA no Shoshi / Akiko ( the oldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga , and later given the name of the Retired Emperor Jotomonin ) as a court lady-cum-tutor , and she served the Empress at least until 1011 . 
There is a poem created by ISE no Taifu , ' Some time ago , double-flowered cherry trees bloomed in the colorful capital of Nara ; today they bloom in Kuju Castle in this capital of Kyo , as they did before , ' which was collected in " Shika Wakashu ( Collection of Poetry ) " ; the poem was written in dedication to the Empress along with yaezakura ( double cherry blossoms ) presented to the Imperial Court ; however , according to " ISE no Taifu shu ( Private Collection ) " it was supposed to be a duty of Murasaki Shikibu , but she delegated the duty to a newcomer , Taifu . 
The last description about Murasaki Shikibu appears in " Shoyuki , " the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke , dated May 25 ( lunar calendar ) 1014 , saying that ' as " a daughter of Tametoki , who was a governor of Echigo Province , " she conveyed a message from the wife of the Retired Empress Shoshi to Sanesuke . ' 
Therefore it is widely believed that she died between 1012 and 1016 , in the reign of Emperor Sanjo , but some people disagree . 
Also , tradition has it that Murasaki Shikibu 's grave can be found at Murasaki no Nishigoshoden-cho ( Horikawa Kitaoji Kudaru , West side ) , Kita Ward , Kyoto City . 
Today , the Bank of Japan 's D-note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu and a part of " The Tale of Genji Emaki ( picture scroll ) " on its back side . 
Her name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( = UNESCO ) , and she was the only Japanese to be thus enrolled . 
You can read some comments about her contemporary famous court ladies . 
Above all , a comment about Sei Shonagon , the author of The Pillow Book , is the most famous ( the following is a free translation ) : 
Sei Shonagon is a jerk who acts proudly . Chinese characters , she blots in a wise , have full of mistakes . ' ( " Murasaki Diary " Kurokawabon ( type of manuscript ) ) 
" Will the life of a person with such insincerity be better in the future ? " ( from " Murasaki Diary " Kurokawabon ) 
These comments are quite severe and can be said to be almost backbiting . 
These descriptions have been brought into conversation with various conjectures and curiosity ( Murasaki Shikibu was jealous of the talent of Sei Shonagon , etc . ) up until recently . 
However , these two people were distant in age and served the Imperial Court in different times ( nearly a decade ) , so they seem not to have known each other . 
She wrote some positive comments about her contemporary female poets , Izumi Shikibu ( ' her behavior is not good , but her poems are excellent , ' etc . ) , and Akazome-emon . 
Emperor Ichijo had a court lady read aloud " The Tale of Genji , " at which he praised the author , saying she must have been an eager reader of Nihongi ( according to " Shoku-Nihongi ( Continuation of Chronicles of Japan ) , " whereby Nihongi refers to " Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) " ; thus some people claim that " Nihongi " in this context means " Nihonshoki " ) . 
Because of this , Murasaki Shikibu was given the nickname ' Nihongi no Otsubone , ' but it is widely thought that the Emperor 's words brought her into ridicule because it was felt that a woman should n't read Chinese classics , and she was distressed by the words . 
Murasaki Diary and " Eiga monogatari ( A Tale of Flowering Fortunes ) , " the latter of which has some descriptions common to the Murasaki Diary , states that Michinaga visited her chamber at night . 
Additionally , " Various Japanese Family Trees " ( " New Compilation of Various Japanese Family Trees Analogy " ) says that ' a court lady of Jotomonin , a poet , Murasaki Shikibu , an author of The Tale of Genji , or Masatada 's granddaughter , Tametoki 's daughter , mistress of Michinaga , the chief adviser to the Emperor , ' which clearly shows that she was a mistress of Michinaga , but the true relationship between them is unknown .

Takauji ASHIKAGA ( 1305-58 ) was a general from the late Kamakura period to the Northern and Southern Courts period . 
He was the 1st Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate . 
Takauji was a descendant of the Genji clan . 
He was the 1st son of Sadauji ASHIKAGA , who was a descendant in the direct line of the Ashikaga clan , which was the powerful family in Kawachi Genji . 
In his early years , he was given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO . 
In 1333 , when the Emperor Go-Daigo had raised an army at Mt . Senjosan in Hoki Province , Takauji , the powerful vassal of the Kamakura shogunate , was sent to Kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion , but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu in Tamba Province to capture Rokuhara Tandai . 
His achievements were evaluated by Emperor Go-Daigo , and he was awarded the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor 's real name Takaharu ( 尊治 ) , so he changed the letter in his name from " 高氏 " to " 尊氏 " . 
While the despotic Kenmu restoration by Emperor Go-Daigo had been losing support , Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion , and stayed in Kamakura to try to build his own government . 
Because of this , the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an impasse , and he returned to Kyoto , driving the Emperor Go-Daigo out to Mt . Hiei . However , the Emperor 's army made a counterattack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily . 
He reentered Kyoto and established a new samurai government called the Muromachi Shogunate , being appointed Seii Taishogun by Grand Emperor ( Retired Emperor ) Kogon and Emperor Komyo . 
At the same time , Emperor Go-Daigo moved to Yoshino and set up the Southern Court there . 
After he established the Muromachi Shogunate , he and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA divided power between them , but in later years discord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance . 
The disturbance subsided with the death of Tadayoshi , but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies , such as the Southern Court forces , to maintain his government . 
After Emperor Go-Daigo died , Takauji built Tenryu-ji Temple to pray for the dead . 
Because of his rebellion against the emperor , people had branded him as a traitor since the Meiji era , but after World War II they began to look at him more positively , which illustrates how much the historical point of view affects the way we look at the people in history . 
From Birth to the Fall of the Kamakura Shogunate 
Takauji was born in 1305 . 
There are 3 presumptions about his birthplace : Ayabe ( Uesugisho in Ayabe City , Kyoto ) , Kamakura and Ashikagano sho ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) . 
" Nan-Taiheiki " says that when Takauji was given his first bath , two turtledoves flew in ; one perched on his shoulder , and the other on the dipper . 
His childhood name was Matataro . 
On October 10th , 1319 , his coming-of-age ceremony ( Genpuku ) was held at age 15 , and he was appointed Jibutaifu of the Fifth Rank , Junior Grade , and given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO . 
Takauji 's father Sadauji and his official wife Shakado , daughter of Akitoki HOJO , had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA , but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father . 
According to " Nan-Taiheiki " , Ietoki ASHIKAGA , Takauji 's grandfather , killed himself with his sword , praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations . 
In 1331 , Emperor Go-Daigo plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kasagi ( Genko Incident ) . 
The Kamakura shogunate ordered Takauji , who had been a powerful vassal , to help the shogunate , and he joined the battles at Kasagi where the emperor was based and at Shimoakasaka Castle in which Masashige KUSUNOKI was based . 
The incident had taken place just after his father 's death , so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate , but the Kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as hostages to make Takauji follow its order . 
According to " Koten-Taiheiki , " because of this Takauji began to harbor hostility toward the shogunate . 
As a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate , the emperor and his followers such as Toshimoto HINO and Enkan were captured , and the following year Emperor Go-Daigo was exiled to Oki Islands ( Genko Rebellion ) . 
The shogunate installed Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line as emperor , instead of Emperor Go-Daigo of the Daikaku-ji line . 
In the following year , Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki Islands , and raised an army at Mt . Senjosan . 
Takauji was ordered to reenter Kyoto with Takaie NAGOE to put down the rebellion in the west . 
Takaie was killed by Norimura AKAMATSU , which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor . On April 29th of the same year , he raised an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu ( present Kameoka City , Kyoto ) in Tamba Province . 
Takauji gathered forces from various provinces , and entered Kyoto followed by vassals such as Doyo SASAKI from Omi Province , and then succeeded in destroying Rokuhara Tandai on May 7th , 1333 . 
At about the same time , Yoshisada NITTA , vassal of Kozuke Province , also gathered an army , and destroyed the shogunate , taking Takauji 's heir Senjuo ( later called Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA ) , who had escaped from Kamakura , with him . 
In this fighting , Takewakamaru , the son of Takauji 's concubine , was killed . 
After the Kamakura shogunate was crumbled , Takauji ordered Kazuuji HOSOKAWA , Yoriharu HOSOKAWA and Morouji HOSOKAWA to make Yoshisada NITTA return to Kyoto , and let the Ashikaga clan rule Kamakura . 
After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate , Emperor Go-Daigo considered Takauji 's work to be commendable , and gave him the ranks of Chinjufu Shogun and Sahyoe no Kami with the courtly title of Fourth Rank , Junior Grade , along with 30 plots of land . 
In addition to that , he was given the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor 's given name , and changed the letter of his name Takauji ( 高氏 ) into Takauji ( 尊氏 ) . 
Under the Kenmu administration , Takauji left politics and let KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , and KO no Moroyasu engage in politics , while he made his brother Tadayoshi the regent of the Kamakura Shogunfu . 
There are two interpretations of Takauji 's behavior ; one is that it was Emperor Go-Daigo who made Takauji leave politics , and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government . 
There is also a different presumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in Kamakura . 
This condition was called " Takauji 's absence in the new government " . 
While Emperor Go-Daigo appointed Akiie KITABATAKE as Chinjufu Shogun and made him take Prince Noriyoshi ( later called Emperor GO-Murakami ) to Oshu in order to pacify the place , Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Narinaga ( Nariyoshi ) down to Kamakura . 
Emperor Go-Daigo 's son Prince Morinaga , who also coveted the title of Seii Taishogun , gradually came to rival Takauji , and plotted to assassinate him , but Takauji 's security was so tight that he failed to do it . 
In 1334 , Takauji captured and confined Prince Morinaga , who was in conflict with the emperor too , to Tadayoshi 's place in Kamakura , conspiring with the emperor 's mistress Yasuko ( Kadoko ) ANO , who wanted to make her son Prince Tsunenaga ( Tsuneyoshi ) a crown prince . 
In 1335 , Nakasendai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the survivors of the HOJO clan , taking Tokiyuki HOJO , bereaved son of Takatoki HOJO , with them , and Tokiyuki 's army occupied Kamakura temporarily . 
In the rebellion , Tadayoshi killed Prince Morinaga without permission . 
Takauji requested that Emperor Go-Daigo appoint him Seii Taishogun only to be rejected , so he marched to Kamakura without emperor 's permission on August 2nd of the same year , which made Emperor Go-Daigo reluctantly appoint him as Seito Taishogun . 
Tadayoshi 's army , joined by Takauji , defeated Tokiyuki HOJO at the Battle of Sagamigawa and regained Kamakura on the 19th of the same month . 
Takauji was given the courtly title of the Second Rank . 
With Tadayoshi 's approval , Takauji established a base in Kamakura and began to allot lands to his followers , ignoring the emperor 's command to return to Kyoto , and he tried to establish his own samurai government . 
In November , Takauji suggested to the emperor that Yoshisada NITTA was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed , but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji , making Yoshisada take Prince Takanaga ( Takayoshi ) to Kamakura along Tokaido . 
Besides that , Akiie KITABATAKE began to go down to Kyoto from Oshu , so Takauji declared his retirement to get a reprieve . However , once the Ashikaga side , including Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao , began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa , Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government . 
In December of the same year , Takauji defeated Nitta 's army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shita , and advanced his army up to Kyoto . 
During that time , Takauji secretly made contact with Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line to justify his entering Kyoto . 
In the following month , Takauji reached Kyoto , while Emperor GO-Daigo fled to Mt . Hiei . 
Shortly thereafter , Takauji was attacked in Kyoto by the armies of Akiie KITABATAKE , Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NITTA from Oshu , and he gave up Kyoto , accepting Enshin AKAMATSU 's advice to leave for Kyushu . 
On his way down to Kyushu , Yoshinao ( Yorihisa ) SHONI came to meet him at Akamagaseki , Nagato Province ( present Shimonoseki City , Yamaguchi Prefecture ) , and he was supported by Ujinori MUNAKATA , the chief priest of Munakata Taisha Shrine in Munakata , Chikuzen Province . 
In the beginning of March , after visiting Munakata Taisha , Takauji defeated Taketoshi KIKUCHI ( Emperor Go-Daigo 's side ) at the Battle of Tatarahama ( present Fukuoka City ) , and on his way up to Kyoto , he got Emperor Kogon 's order and immediately gathered western warriors . 
He smashed the armies of Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI at the Battle of Minatogawa on April 25th of the same year , and seized Kyoto again in June . 
Takauji attempted a reconciliation with Emperor Go-Daigo , who had been at Mt . Hiei , to save face for the emperor . 
Emperor Go-Daigo , accepting Takauji 's offer , transferred the Imperial Regalia of Japan to Emperor Komyo , a younger brother of Grand Emperor Kogon , and right after that , on November 7th , Takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government , setting the Kenmu Shikimoku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people . 
Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Kyoto to Yoshino ( present Yoshino-cho , Yoshino-gun , Nara Prefecture ) taking the Imperial Regalia of Japan with him in December , and announced that the transferred regalia were fake , so he established Yoshino Imperial Court ( = Southern Court ) . 
In 1338 , Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun ( reigned 1338-58 ) by Emperor Komyo , which meant that an actual samurai government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established . 
In the following year , when Emperor Go-Daigo passed away in Yoshino , Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor . 
In order to raise the funds to build the temple , a trading vessel called Tenryu-ji-bune was set sail for Yuan Dynasty . 
Under the new government , Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals . 
Shin 'ichi Sato called such conditions diarchy by Takauji , who held a military power in the lord-and-vassal relationship , and Tadayoshi , who controlled the judicial functions of the regime , in his essay ' Muromachi Bakufu ' in " Iawanami Koza Nihon Rekishi vol.7 " ( Iawanami Publishing , 1963 ) and explained that the potentiality of the shogun 's dual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate , came to appear . 
The dual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-Tadayoshi group represented by KO no Moronao , and the Tadayoshi group in the government . 
This conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance . 
At first Takauji took a neutral stance on it , but he came to side with Moronao 's group . 
In 1349 , Moronao demanded Tadayoshi 's retirement from politics , surrounding Takauji 's castle in which Tadayoshi had sheltered . 
Tadayoshi became a priest and lost his power , but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to exclude Tadayoshi . 
While Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from Kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi , he sent his second son Motouji ASHIKAGA to Kamakura in return and set the Kamakurafu to rule the eastern provinces , appointing Motouji Kamakura kubo . 
After Tadayoshi 's retreat , Takauji 's illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi 's adopted son - Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA was enlarging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu , so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tadafuyu in 1350 . 
Then Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and sided with the Southern Court , followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MOMONOI and Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA . 
When Tadayoshi 's army grew stronger , Yoshiakira became powerless and fled from Kyoto . Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi 's army at Uchidehama in Settsu Province ( present Nishinomiya City , Hyogo Prefecture ) . 
Takauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests , and they came to an agreement in 1351 . 
The KO brothers were assassinated by Yoshinori UESUGI while they were under escort . 
Tadayoshi became Yoshiakira 's assistant and got involved in political affairs again . 
Takauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the ostensible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by Doyo SASAKI and Sokuyu ( Norisuke ) AKAMATSU , but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court , conspiring to kill Tadayoshi and Tadafuyu . 
Sensing this conspiracy , Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached Kamakura . 
In October of the same year , Takauji and the Southern Court reconciled , an event that was called Shohei-itto . 
At the same time , Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the Tokaido , and defeated him at the battles of Mt . Satsutamayama in Suruga Province ( present-day Shimizu Ward , Shimizu City , Shizuoka Prefecture ) and Hayakawajiri in Sagami Province ( present-day Odawara City , Kanagawa Prefecture ) . Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in Kamakura . 
Tadayoshi died suddenly in February , 1352 . 
" Taiheiki " says that Tadayoshi might have been poisoned by Takauji . 
Soon after Tadayoshi 's death , being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Muneyoshi , Yoshioki NITTA , Yoshimune NITTA and Tokiyuki HOJO , Takauji retreated to Musashi Province , but soon returned to Kyoto to defeat the Southern forces . 
After that Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA intruded in Kyoto , but eventually he left for Kyushu . 
In 1354 , Kyoto was retaken by the Southern Court temporarily , but taken back by Takauji the following year . 
He plotted to kill Tadafuyu , but died of a tumor on his back at the palace of Made 'nokoji in Nijo , Kyoto , on April 30th , 1358 . 
His age at death : 54 . 
According to " Baishoron , " Takauji regretted having turned against Emperor Go-Daigo , and he for a while he was talking about becoming a priest . In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself , so Shin 'ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration , and presumed that Takauji might have been a manic depressive . 
Takauji 's close friend Soseki MUSO described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing . 
Takauji was willing to allot lands to his military commanders , which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations . 
It was the Mitogaku originated by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA that started to consider Takauji as a traitor in the Edo period . 
Mitogaku was strongly influenced by Shushigaku Meibunron , and emphasized the validity of the Imperial line . 
Because of this , Takauji , who exiled the authentic emperor ( Go-Daigo ) , was described in a negative way as a traitor . 
Mitogaku 's view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations , and in the late Tokugawa period when Sonno-Joi ( Revere the Emperor , Expel the Barbarian ) culminated , the heads of wooden statues of Takauji , Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu ( ASHIKAGA ) in Toji-in were pilloried . 
After the Meiji period , the Meiji government sought to establish a nation-state which set the emperor in the center of the nation . This produced a nationalistic view of history , which justified Taisei Hokan and Osei Fukko , and so the Taika Reforms , Kenmu no Chuko ( = Kenmu restoration ) and Meiji Restoration were ranked as the most important reforms . 
Until mid Meiji period , source-based study of modern history did not emphasize the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo ( the Southern Court ) , but at around 1907 40 when the Nanbokucho Seijunron arose , the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo came to be stressed , creating a negative evaluation of Takauji . 
According to an authorized textbook written before WWII , Takauji was " a traitor who released an arrow against the Emperor " , and Kumakichi NAKAJIMA , a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet , was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing . 
After WWII , the nationalistic view of history became obsolete , and the source-based study of history made progress on reevaluating Takauji . 
Sato 's interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the lord-and-vassal relationship was one example , which afforded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government . 
In today 's historical study , nobody interprets Takauji as a traitor any more , and the process of Takauji 's becoming a traitor sometimes can be a theme of historical study . 
" Shihon Taiheiki " written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA in the late 1950s had Takauji as a main character , and was accepted by many readers , which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before WWII . 
" Kibamusha zo " ( a portrait of warrior on the horse back ) , preserved in the Kyoto National Museum , was generally known as a portrait of Takauji , but is now considered to be a portrait of KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , or that of KO no Moroakira , son of Moronao . It 's because there 's a decorative signature of the 2nd shogun Yoshiakira on the upper part of the body , and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior 's harness was not the Ashikaga family 's , but the KO family 's . 
Portrait of Taira no Shigemori , one of the Jingo-ji san zo , painted by FUJIWARA no Takanobu in Kamakura period , had been considered a portrait of Shigemori TAIRA , but Michio YONEKURA and Hideo KURODA claimed that it is a portrait of Takauji , and now this interpretation is widely accepted . 
Their opinion is based on the comparison of the portrait with the wooden statue of Takauji preserved in Toji-in , and the popular shape of the hatpin , called Kogai , used in the early Muromachi period . 
There 's another portrait of Takauji preserved in Jodo-ji Temple in Onomichi City , Hiroshima Prefecture . 
In addition to that , there are some ukiyoe pictures of Takauji : " Taiheiki Kassenzu , " by Yoshitora UTAGAWA ; and " Ashikaga Takauji Hyogo Kassenzu , " by Chikanobu HASHIMOTO . Both paintings deal with Takauji sheltering in the Jodo-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture . 
Also some bronze statues of Takauji were made recently ; one is placed on the approach to the Bunna-ji Temple in Ashikaga City , and the other is in Ankokuji Town , Ayabe City , Kyoto Prefecture .

Reference 
The private local bus operators Keihan Kyoto Kotsu ( formerly Kyoto Kotsu ( Kameoka Station ) , Kyoto Kotsu ( Maizuru ) and Kyoto Bus have no capital or personnel relationship with Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau . 
The labor union of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau is Kyoto Kotsu Labor Unions ( a member of the All Japan Municipal Transport Workers ' Union ) . 
The labor union of Kyoto Bus Co . , Ltd . , is the Kyoto Bus Labor Union , and the labor union of Keihan Kyoto Kotsu is the Keihan Kyoto Bus Labor Union ( both of which are members of the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Workers ' Union Japan ) . 
The Kyoto City Transportation Bureau is the only Japanese transportation enterprise that holds the copyright to its departure melodies . 
In 2007 , one of its bus lines was found to be in service without an approval of the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism . 
One Kyoto City bus appeared in a local campaign film during the 2007 fiscal year , which was produced by the Japan Ad Council with a message saying , " It runs on waste tempura oil . " 
The commercial film says that bio-diesel fuel made from waste vegetable oil is used for city buses and garbage trucks as a substitute for light oil in their activities , as a means for the prevention of global warming as advocated by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 . 
This commercial film , produced by the Japan Ad Council 's Osaka Bureau , aired mainly on Kansai local TV ( partially nationwide ) . 
The Seimei-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Kamigyo Ward of Kyoto City . 
It 's dedicated to Seimei ABE . 
It 's located at the site of his premises , which once existed near ( northwest of ) the Ichijo Modori-bashi . 
There are many shrines nationwide with the same name . 
When Seimei died in 1005 , Ichijyo , the Emperor of the time , admired his work and called him the reincarnation of Inari the god . A shrine was built and dedicated to him at the site of his premises in 1007 . 
The area of the shrine was large at first but gradually diminished through events like wars and the urban improvement by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and its buildings were left decayed . 
From the last days of the Tugawa shogunate , the shrine 's buildings and precincts were repaired by funds raised mainly by the shrine parishioners . In 1950 , the shrine 's area was changed to face Horikawa street . 
During the Heisei era , Seimei ABE became extremely popular and worshipers have come to visit the shrine from all over the country . 
The millennium commemoration for Seimei ABE was held in 2005 , when a thousand years had passed since his death .

The 22 Shrines are part of the Shakaku for Shinto shrines . 
They were established from the middle to late Heian period . 
These shrines receive special offerings from the Imperial Court . 
They are mostly chosen from shrines in the Kinai area . 
Establishment of the 22 Shrines 
Under the Ritsuryo system , offerings were given by the Imperial court for Kinen-sai and other festivals to many shrines listed in the Engi-shiki Jimmyo-cho ; but that number has been reduced to a special few shrines after the decline of the Ritsuryo system . 
That number and the shrines in it changed many times and came to include some newly established shrines , before being finalized as the following 22 Shrines in 1081 . 
Although the movement at the end of the Heian period to include Itsukushima Shrine was not successful , that shrine received offerings from the imperial court until the latter part of the Muromachi period , and even in the Edo period in the event of disasters .
